Some such hopefuls told TOI that they had worn out their shoes visiting the district administrative offices, only to be dismissed with a string of excuses about their cases. Mustafabad resident Arifís boutique tailoring shop in Mahalakshmi Enclave was burnt down on February 25, 2020. ìI suffered losses of around Rs 6 lakh. I filed an FIR and visited the SDMís office and was told I needed to fill some forms. This was done, but nothing has happened so far,î said Arif. ìI have had to make my sons aged 13 and 15 years quit school and work to make ends meet. We also had to sell the jewellery we had saved for my daughterís wedding. Only one thing remains for me to do: consume poison and die.î Itís not just Arif who is at his witís end. Many others too are in the same predicament. While some have been asked to produce documents that perished when their houses were destroyed by the mobs, others have been instructed to submit photographic proof of the attack on their properties, which they donít have having fled from their houses for days altogether. Shezad Ashgar Zaidi, 50, whose electronics and computer store was looted on February 25 two years ago, said he went to his ransacked shop to locate his education certificates. ìEverything, including laptops and other equipment, were gone and whatever remained had been burnt down. I couldnít find my certificates,î said Zaidi. ìI did click some photographs as a record of things that were stolen or burnt, but a mob attacked me and only set me free after I deleted those pictures. How is one supposed to get proof in such a scenario?î Zaidi claimed having filled several forms and received Rs 5,000 as compensation. ìWhen one has lost not only stocks worth lakhs of rupees but livelihood itself, how is this puny sum going to help? I approached MLAs and MPs, to no avail,î sighed Zaidi. Mohammad Aslam Khan, 49, resident of Shiv Vihar, ran for his life and the rioters took away his two motorcycles and everything from his house. ìWe filled forms, provided our bank account numbers, but we have received no help,î he said. ìMy two bikes only cost around Rs 2 lakh, but the mob also took everything from our home, our fridge, TV and all other essential things. I have four children and donít know how to secure their future.î Najis, 33, and her husband, Aseen, 35, suffered a similar fate. The Shiv Vihar residents were lucky to be saved by their Hindu neighbour but lost all their household items. ìThe rioters broke the rear wall of our house and carted away our belongings. We stayed at Idgah for a month before returning home,î revealed Najis. ìMy husband suffers dizzy spells frequently and canít do much work. We have four children and we are surviving on help from here and there.î Idgah provided temporary residence for a month to Ashrafi Begum, 60, and her husband, Zaleel Khan, too. ìThe rioters stole the Rs 3 lakh we had collected for our daughterís wedding as well as the house registry papers,î claimed Begum. ìThe officials asked us to show proof of the stolen cash and jewellery. We showed pictures of our sonís wedding to prove the jewellery was ours but had no evidence of the cash. This only got us a small sum as compensation.î Several similarly struggling families in Shiv Vihar are seeking help from Neev-Foundation for Legal Aid. ìMost cases for compensation are stagnant in Delhi High Court. Two years after the riots, we are still getting requests for sustenance from the victims,î said Mishika Singh, founder-chairperson, Neev. "
1	"NEW DELHI: A local court has framed charges against 10 persons in a Delhi riots case, saying they were members of an unlawful assembly formed with an objective to create fear and panic amongst the Hindu community and threaten them to leave the country. According to the police, the 10 accused men resorted to violence and loot, and set ablaze the properties belonging to ""members of the Hindu community"" at Delhi's Bhagirathi Vihar area on February 25, 2020. Relying on the statements of witnesses, Additional Sessions Judge Virender Bhat said, ""Material on record prima facie discloses that the accused were the members of an unlawful assembly which had been formed with the object to create fear and panic amongst the people belonging to Hindu Community, to threaten them to leave the country and to cause arson, loot."" The judge, in an order dated December 13, framed charges against Mohd Shahnawaz, Mohd Shoaib, Shahrukh, Rashid, Azad, Ashraf Ali, Parvez, Mohd Faisal, Rashid, and Mohd Tahir. It has invoked sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 436 (mischief by fire), 452 (house-trespass with preparation to assault), 454 (lurking house-trespass), 392 (robbery), 427 (mischief) read with Section 149 (unlawful assembly) of the Indian Penal Code. The FIR was registered on a complaint filed by one Jagdish Prasad who said the rioters burnt his son's auto spare parts shop. Prasad also claimed that the mob threw a petrol bomb into the shop as a result of which it got burnt. He further stated that he, along with his two brothers, managed to escape from the rear gate to save their lives. Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi in February 2020 after violence between the supporters of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and those protesting against it spiraled out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured.

2	"NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Monday refused to grant bail to an accused in a case concerning the northeast Delhi riots of 2020, saying that there was ""pre-planned and pre-meditated conspiracy to disturb law and order in the city"" and events ""did not take place in a spur of the moment"". Justice Subramonium Prasad, while dealing with a bail application moved by one Mohd Ibrahim in the case concerning the alleged murder of Delhi Police head constable Ratan Lal, observed that there was a systematic disconnection and destruction of the CCTV cameras in areas near the place of the incident and ""innumerable rioters ruthlessly descended with sticks, dandas, bats, etc. upon a hopelessly outnumbered cohort of police officials"". ""The riots which shook the National Capital of the country in February 2020 evidently did not take place in a spur of the moment, and the conduct of the protestors who are present in the video footage which has been placed on record by the prosecution visibly portrays that it was a calculated attempt to dislocate the functioning of the Government as well as to disrupt the normal life of the people in the city,"" the court said. ""The systematic disconnection and destruction of the CCTV cameras also confirm the existence of a preplanned and pre-meditated conspiracy to disturb law and order in the city,"" it added. Dismissing the bail application of Ibrahim, the court stated that the available video footage showing the petitioner with the sword was ""quite egregious"" and sufficient to keep him in custody. ""A perusal of the material on record has revealed to the court that the petitioner has been identified on multiple CCTV footages, carrying a sword and instigating the crowd. The clinching evidence that tilts this Court towards prolonging the incarceration of the Petitioner is that the weapon which is being carried by the Petitioner is capable of causing grievous injuries and/or death, and is prima facie a dangerous weapon,"" the court stated. The judge while acknowledging the importance of personal liberty in a democratic polity, clarified that ""individual liberty cannot be misused in a manner that threatens the very fabric of civilized society by attempting to destabilise it and cause hurt to other persons"". ""Even though the petitioner cannot be seen at the Scene of Crime, he was a part of the mob for the sole reason that the Petitioner had consciously traveled 1.6 km away from his neighborhood with a sword which could only be used to incite violence and inflict damage,"" the court said. The petitioner, Ibrahim, was arrested in December 2020 and has been in judicial custody since then. He sought bail on the ground that he never participated in any protest or the riots at any point in time and the place on a record by the prosecution did not place him anywhere close to the scene of the crime. The court, in a separate order, granted bail to one Saleem Khan, saying that in the absence of any material to show that he was a part of the unlawful assembly at the crime scene, the veracity of the allegations levelled against him can be tested during trial.

3	"NEW DELHI: A Delhi has granted bail to four people in three murder cases related to the northeast Delhi riots after the sole eyewitness did not identify the accused during his deposition. Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat granted relief to Ashok Kumar, Jitender Kumar, Ajay and Shubham on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 10,000 with one surety of like amount each. The accused had sought bail after witness Shashi Kant did not identify them. The court noted that keeping in mind the nature of the deposition of the witness, the special public prosecutor, appearing for police, fairly submitted that he had no objection to the bail applications. ""Considering the nature of the testimony of witness Shashi Kant, which was recorded in this case and taking into account no objection given by the SPP, the bail application is hereby allowed,"" it said in similar orders passed on the three cases related to rioting in Dayalpur. It directed the accused not to leave the territory of NCT of Delhi during the trial and to appear before the court on each and every date of hearing. The cases relate to the alleged murder of Ashfaaq, Zakir and Mehtab, who were caught and severely beaten up by a mob during the communal violence on February 25, 2020, which ultimately led to their death. A perusal of the postmortem report of deceased Zakir revealed that he had received as many as 22 injuries, out of which seven injuries were so grave in nature that they itself were sufficient to cause death of any person in ordinary course of nature. A review of the postmortem of Ashfaaq revealed that he had received 31 injuries, out of which one injury was sufficient to cause death under ordinary circumstances. All the injuries were fresh before death. Some of the injuries were caused by a sharp-edged weapon and the rest were due to application of the blunt force. The postmortem of Mehtab showed that he had received 11 injuries, out of which three injuries were opined to be caused by a sharp-edged sword and were so grave in nature that they itself were sufficient to cause death of any person in ordinary course of nature. At the stage of hearing of their earlier bail arguments, the court had noted that the eyewitness, who was a resident of the locality, had duly identified the accused allegedly indulging in rioting while one of them was carrying a sword.

4	"NEW DELHI: Congratulating the Delhi Police for a fair investigation into the Delhi riots cases, Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday said that the department has done the job of presenting the rioters before the courts with strictness and justice. ""I congratulate Delhi Police for the role it played during the Covid pandemic and the Delhi riots, particularly for fair and strict investigation of the riots,"" the Home Minister said at the 75th Raising Day parade of Delhi Police. Communal riots broke out in the national capital in February, 2020, during which over 50 people were killed. Since then the Delhi Police has been investigating the riots and has detained and produced several accused people before the courts. A total of 695 cases are being investigated by north-east district police while 62 cases such as murders were transferred to the Crime Branch, where three dedicated special investigation teams investigated the cases under continuous monitoring of superior officers. On January 20, a Delhi court sentenced a man for 5 years, convicted for burning down the house of a 73-year-old woman. With inputs from IANS"
5	"NEW DELHI: Shahrukh Pathan, who had allegedly pointed a gun at a police head constable during the 2020 Delhi riots, on Thursday told a court that he did not fire shots at the cop and merely wanted to scare him and not kill, a claim opposed by the prosecution. A photograph of Pathan pointing a gun at Delhi Police head constable Deepak Dahiya had gone viral on social media during the communal riots last year.  He was arrested on March 3, 2020, and is currently lodged in Tihar Jail. To show that there was no attempt to murder the cop, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy, representing Pathan, played a 26-seconds long video of the incident in the court and said that the accused fired two shots - one in the air and second to his right, following which he had a heated conversation with Dahiya and turned back. Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat then asked the lawyer to replay the video and pointed towards the position of Pathan's gun just before he shot fire in the air.  ""Look at the position of his gun. It is not pointed up. It is straight [at Dahiya]. When he is taking the aim, it is straight,"" the judge noted. The advocate, however, clarified that neither of the two gunshots was aimed at the head constable.  ""The state's case is based on Dahiya. He is the potential victim and is not fired at. The first is in the air and the second is on the right,"" she said. Guruswamy added, ""If I (accused) wanted to shoot him, I would have but that was not the intention. The accused turned around and ran away. Does any of this demonstrate the intention to kill or shoot him? At best, this is the intention to scare."" Pathan's counsel said that he did not shoot Dahiya but instead asked him to step back.  ""We had a conversation as heated as it can be and then we retreated. Where is the intention to kill?"" she submitted. She further said, ""I had ample opportunity in this 26 seconds to kill Dahiya or to say the least to injure him. I am trying to scare him. Objectionable as it is for a citizen to scare a police officer, Section 307 IPC [attempt to murder] is not made out because I had no intention to kill."" Special Public Prosecutor Anuj Handa, appearing for the police, said that the accused had clearly pointed the gun at the cop. Opposing Guruswamy's arguments that Pathan had no intention to kill the cop, Handa said, ""The gun is pointed slightly downwards directly at the head of the complainant. His hand going upwards is because of the recoil after shots are fired."" ""The question I ask myself is this, during the first part of the video, he shoots at the different directions of the mob, who might be belonging to the different community. Suppose any person would have succumbed to the injuries, would the offence not have been made out?"" the prosecutor asked. Pathan is facing charges of offences such as rioting with a deadly weapon, an attempt to murder, assault, and obstructing public servants in the discharge of duty under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Arms Act. Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi in February 2020, after violence between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and its protesters spiraled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured.

6	"NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has framed charges of murder and rioting against 12 people for the lynching of a man during the 2020 Delhi riots, reports Usha Das.  The prosecution told additional sessions judge Virender Bhat that the accused were members of an unlawful assembly on February 25 and 26, and their aim was to avenge the death of some members of their community. To this end, they allegedly bludgeoned one Aas Mohammad to death. The special public prosecutor, appearing for Delhi Police, submitted that messages sent on a WhatsApp group during the riots clearly reveal the 12 had hatched a conspiracy. The counsel for the accused conceded the charges for all the offences except that of criminal conspiracy. Charges framed under Section 144 Later, additional sessions judge Virender Bhat framed charges against the accused under sections 144 (joining unlawful assembly armed with deadly weapon), 147 and 148 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 302 (murder) IPC. He, however, discharged all of them from the charge of criminal conspiracy. "
7	"NEW DELHI: With more bodies being recovered from drains and people in hospitals dying of injuries, the death toll in the north-east Delhi communal riots rose to 38 on Thursday. However, no incident of violence has been reported since Tuesday night and life is slowly returning to normal. Prohibitory orders imposed under Section 144 will be relaxed for 10 hours on Friday in view of the improvement in the ground situation. Delhi Police has arrested over 130 people, detained over 400 and registered 48 FIRs. It has also booked Aam Aadmi Party councillor Tahir Hussain and his associates in the case of murder of Intelligence Bureau official Ankit Sharma. He is yet to be arrested. Sharma‚Äôs case, along with other cases of riots, have been transferred to the crime branch and a special investigation team (SIT) ‚Äî as reported by TOI on Thursday ‚Äî has been set up to probe the case. Delhi violence: Live updatesThe SIT will also probe a ‚Äúlarger conspiracy‚Äù, which cops suspect was hatched over a period. Their suspicion has been strengthened by the recoveries made from the area which include improvised hand grenades tied with rope and ‚Äúbottle bomb launchers‚Äù which resemble a big-size slingshot tied to trees or fences to make it look like swings. These arrangements could not have been made overnight, said a source. Meanwhile, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Thursday that Delhi government will bear all medical expenses of the riot victims even if they are admitted to private hospitals and give up to Rs 10 lakh as compensation to the kin of the dead and up to Rs 5 lakh each to those who have lost their houses and shops in the riots. Eighteen subdivisional magistrates (SDMs) have been deployed to monitor the relief and rehabilitation operations. The Delhi LG on Thursday reviewed the situation and directed the police to ensure continued and adequate deployment of force apart from carrying out enhanced patrolling and area domination exercises. Four teams of Delhi FSL ‚Äî physics, biology, chemistry and photo ‚Äî visited several spots in the area to lift samples. The authorities will now make efforts for quick disposal of burnt vehicles, lifting of malba, clearing of animal carcasses and repair of roads, signages, government assets and religious structures, in coordination with the police. ‚ÄúThe LG has also asked for setting up of sufficient number of shelter homes with basic amenities, including beddings, blankets, medicines, food, sanitation and clean drinking water, ensuring timely medico-legal certificates and post-mortem reports etc. to the victims and their families,‚Äù said a government official. The principal secretary (law) was asked to coordinate with the district legal services authorities to provide immediate legal aid to the victims. Arrangements are being made in coordination with IHBAS for counselling of riot victims to treat those with post-traumatic stress disorder and any other issues. The LG has also asked the revenue department to adopt confidence-building measures and make a quick survey of the quantum of loss to individuals, families, business establishments, shops and institutions and ensure speedy compensation. Special CP Sundari Nanda, assisted by East Delhi Municipal Corporation officials, health department and district administration, will meet the injured and families of the deceased personally and ensure that all steps are taken to provide them help. Delhi Police has appealed to people residing in north-east Delhi that if they had witnessed violent incidents, they should come forward and share their ordeal and videos with the police. The locals can also send videos and pictures through WhatsApp on two mobile numbers ‚Äî8750871221 and 8750871227. Watch Delhi riots: Bodies found in drains, death toll rises to 38"
8	"NEW DELHI: A court has framed charges of rioting and other offences against three men for allegedly setting a mosque on fire during the northeast Delhi riots, noting that the delay in recording the statements of two witnesses couldn't be held fatal to the prosecution case at the stage of deciding charges. Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat framed charges of rioting, unlawful assembly and arson against Deepak, Prince and Shiv for allegedly vandalising and setting the Janati mosque on fire on February 24, 2020 in Gokalpuri. ""No doubt, the statements of these two witnesses have been recorded on September 5, 2021, but they have clearly mentioned that they did not disclose the incident to police on account of fear and it is when police reached their shop in Ganga Vihar for making inquiries regarding their complaint in (another) case that they garnered courage to make a statement in this case,"" the court said on February 11. It also noted that constables Raksh and Vipin stated that when they reached Ganga Vihar along with the investigating officer on March 9, 2020, head constable Mahesh had told them that these three rioters, along with two associates, who allegedly committed vandalisation and arson in the mosque, were present in the A block park. Mahesh had identified all of them in a CCTV footage given to him by a secret informer, the cops said. Police arrested the accused after this, and ""therefore, it cannot be said the arrest of the accused on March 9, 2020 was without any evidence"", the court pointed out. ""The evidence was there in the shape of video footage... though the CD containing it was seized by the investigating officer on the next day,"" it added. The counsel for the accused had argued that the initial chargesheet was filed without any evidence against them and two of the witnesses were planted later. "
9	"NEW DELHI: Activist Khalid Saifi, accused in a case related to the larger conspiracy in northeast Delhi violence in 2020, on Wednesday told a court that Delhi police was attempting to communalise the matter. He made the submissions through his counsel before Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat, who reserved the order on his bail application. Senior Advocate Rebecca John, appearing for Saifi, told the court that the evidence produced by the Delhi police did not add up as it was based on conjectures and surmises. The senior advocate referred to the submission made by the prosecution that protest was communal, was not organic and it was a conspiracy of silence. ""My friend (public prosecutor) said protests were communal, not organic. Let us assume, even if it was not organic. Protests are organised. So what? Prosecution has sought to communalise this case. One community (was) affected by this bill (Citizenship (Amendment) Act). It is their right to protest"", she said. ""Why is prosecution attempting to communalize the narrative? Don't lay the narrative on one community. Don't brush aside the actions of Delhi Police, that too apparent from a reading of this WhatsApp group,"" the counsel said. She referred to a message which read Delhi Police breaking public cameras to avoid accountability. ""But no investigation was made into this,"" she said. John further submitted that the prosecution was relying on some chats in the Delhi Protest Support Group (DPSG). She shared the screenshot of a message sent by Khalid Saifi in the group which read, 'open, clear, inaction of police for the violence. The CM must be held accountable for the same. Protest must be held outside his residence.' ""How this incriminates me (Saifi) beats my reasoning or imagination. I own the message,"" she said. The court, meanwhile, adjourned the arguments on the bail plea of former JNU student Umar Khalid for Friday on a plea by his counsel. She further submitted that none of the ingredients under section 15 ( terrorist act) and section 17 ( terror funding) UAPA, levelled against Saifi, were met. Even for Section 18 (conspiracy to commit Terrorist Act) of UAPA were not satisfied, the counsel said. Saifi, along with several others, has been booked under the anti-terror law in the case for being the ""masterminds"" of the February 2020 riots, which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured. The violence had erupted during the protests against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens. Besides him, former JNU student leader Umar Khalid, JNU students Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, Jamia Coordination Committee members Safoora Zargar, former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain and several others have also been booked under the stringent law in the case.

Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat, however, discharged Firoz and Mohd Anwar in two other cases, saying there was no evidence against the accused. The court framed charges against them in a case of alleged looting and setting ablaze shops in Dayalpur in February 2020. It noted that it was true that in his complaint, the complainant had not made any prayer for setting in motion the legal machinery to nab the culprits; but had he not wanted so, he would not have approached the police station and visited the office of the subdivisional magistrate concerned with the demand for compensation. The court said it was the mandatory duty of the officer-incharge of a police station to register the FIR on the basis of a complaint if the same disclosed the commission of a cognisable offence. ìThe officer-incharge of the police station cannot refuse registration of the FIR merely for the reason that no such request has been made in the complaint. It is for him to examine the complaint in order to ascertain whether or not any cognisable offence has taken place and if so, to register the FIR,î the court observed. It further said the witness and constable Vikas, who was the beat officer on duty, clearly identified the accused persons as allegedly being part of the unlawful assembly. ìI find sufficient prima facie evidence on record to frame charges against the accused and put them to trial,î the judge said. While discharging them in two other riot cases, the court said the witness, constable Ankit, had nowhere stated that he had seen the accused indulging in vandalisation and arson in the shops/houses of the complainants. ìIt does not appear from the entire material on record that at the time of apprehending these two accused, there was any material with the IO showing their involvement in the riotous incidents,î it remarked.

Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat of Karkardooma court will now pronounce the order next Monday (March 21). On March 3, the same bench had reserved its order on Khalid's bail plea after hearing the submissions of parties in the matter. Opposing the bail plea, Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) Amit Prasad argued on the relevance of the speech given by Umar Khalid in Amravati in February 2020. He said the bail application was rejected on February 11, pointing out that the announcement of Donald Trump visiting India came on the same day. During the course of the hearing, Khalid's counsel, opposing the charges under the Indian Penal Code and UAPA, termed the charge sheet a 'work of fiction'. He argued that the speech given by Khalid was about Gandhi, harmony, and the Constitution, and it is not a crime. After the submissions, the court had reserved the order. Khalid, one of the accused in the conspiracy case, has been booked under the anti-terror law -- Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The riots broke out in northeast Delhi in February 2020 after clashes between anti-CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) and pro-CAA protesters took a violent turn. The mayhem, which coincided with then US President Donald Trump's maiden trip to India, saw over 50 people lose their lives and over 700 injured. "
13	"NEW DELHI: In the first order convicting a man in a north-east Delhi riots case, a local court has said the circumstances in which members of the Muslim community were identified and beaten up by a mob and the fact that the accused, who was amongst the rioters, was armed are sufficient to indicate beyond any doubt he shared the common objective to assault Muslims and damage their properties. TOI reported in its Tuesday edition that the court on Monday convicted Dinesh Yadav (25) for being part of the mob that had set on fire a 73-year-old woman's house in Gokalpuri on February 25, 2020. The woman was not present in the house when the incident occurred. Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat said though the evidence on record did not indicate that Yadav had directly committed the offence, yet he was to be held guilty of all the offences committed by the members of unlawful assembly because he shared their common objective and knew that these offences were likely to be committed. While delivering the judgement, the court took note of ""the circumstances in which members of the Muslim community were identified and beaten, their vehicles damaged and their houses broken open, robbed and set ablaze by the rioters, comprising members of the other community"". It noted that the accused was armed with a wooden rod. These are ""sufficient to indicate beyond any doubt that he too shared the common object of the assembly and had knowledge that these types of incidents would be indulged in by the members of the assembly,"" the judge said in the order. The court noted that it was true that the testimony of the beat police officials and the two eyewitnesses to the incident revealed that Yadav had not taken an active part in vandalizing, looting or setting on fire the house of the complainant. However, it cannot be said that he was only a bystander or a passive spectator at the spot, said the court. TimesViewThe Delhi riots happened in February 2020. It is good that the first conviction has taken place. Hopefully more convictions will follow in the coming weeks. It is important that riot victims do not feel let down by the justice system.""The mere fact that he was not seen entering the complainant's house or vandalizing or looting or putting it on fire does not mean that he was a mere bystander,"" said the court. It added that the testimony of the beat police officials, on the other hand, clearly indicated that on February 25, 2020, Yadav was part of an unlawful assembly, consisting of 200-300 rioters who indulged in large-scale riots in Bhagirathi Vihar, Delhi. It observed that from the deposition of the prosecution witnesses, it was seen that the rioters belonged to the Hindu community whereas the victims were members of the Muslim community. "

15	"NEW DELHI: Escalating the crackdown on controversial Islamist outfit Popular Frontpfiof India (PFI), Delhi Police‚Äôs Special Cell has arrested its Delhi unit president, Parvez Ahmed, and secretary, Mohammad Iliyas, for allegedly funding the riots and fanning violence during anti-CAA protests in the city. Earlier, police had arrested Danish Khan, a secretary of PFI. The arrested men ‚Äî Ahmed and Iliyas ‚Äî were already under investigation by the Enforcement Directorate which is studying PFI‚Äôs financial transactions as part of a probe into the role of the outfit in anti-CAA protests. The ED claims to have seized a tablet device from Parvez which purportedly has records of a chain of conversations about anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh and violence at JNU between him and a member of Parliament. The agencies have also established a suspicious pattern of deposits into and withdrawal of money from PFI‚Äôs accounts. Iliyas was first to be arrested from Jafrabad on Wednesday, while Parvez was picked up from Parliament Street in the evening where a protest against the arrest of Danish was planned. Sources said that the cops made Iliyas call up Parvez to the ‚Äúprotest site‚Äù and arrested him upon arrival. The Special Cell claims to have clinching evidence about PFI spreading fake propaganda and fanning violence during the anti-CAA protests. Danish, who was arrested earlier, handled the outfit‚Äôs intelligence wing and was spotted at all major protests in the city. ‚ÄúHis interrogation has given clues regarding the outfit‚Äôs ‚Äòinformation war,‚Äô‚Äù an officer said. The FIR, in the case was filed by the Crime Branch, but since the larger conspiracy regarding the Delhi riots is being probed by the Special Cell, the matter has been transferred to them, said a senior official. PFI has, however, called the move a conspiracy against it. ‚ÄúWhatever happens in India, the agencies put their blame on us. Never in the past have such allegations been proved. Even this time, we will come out clean,‚Äù the outfit stated. Watch Delhi: PFI President, Secretary arrested by special cell"
16	"NEW DELHI: A Delhi Court on Saturday dismissed the bail plea moved by former AAP Councilor Tahir Hussain in a money laundering case registered by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the alleged funding of Northeast Delhi violence of February 2020. Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat dismissed the bail plea on Saturday. He had reserved the order on 8 February after hearing the arguments of counsel of the prosecution and accused. Tahir Hussain is accused in many riots related cases and in custody for one and half years. He is also an accused in the riots conspiracy case. Advocate N. K. Matta, Special Prosecutor for ED had argued that there is sufficient material on record against the accused and a case of Money laundering is made out against him. "
17	"New Delhi: The president of Alumni Association of Jamia Milia Islamia (AAJMI) Shifa-Ur Rehman alleged before a court on Monday that there had been systemic violation of his fundamental rights by the prosecution in a northeast Delhi riot case. His counsel claimed that the sanction for prosecution granted in the case was not fair and honest as the material of the investigation was reviewed by an independent authority before the probe was completed. ‚ÄúThere are discrepancies regarding Rehman‚Äôs arrest too. His arrest memo shows that he was arrested from Uttar Pradesh. But in the chargesheet, it shows that he was arrested by the ACP concerned in Delhi,‚Äù Rehman‚Äôs counsel told additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat during the hearing of his bail plea. ‚ÄúAlso, he was called to the police station and then arrested. He was willing to cooperate,‚Äù he said. The counsel added that during the initial days of custody, Rehman was not allowed to interact with his lawyer. ‚ÄúAAJMI has 10 office bearers. None other than him has been arraigned as an accused. He was also part of Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC)... Being a part of AAJMI or JCC is not sufficient to make a person part of a conspiracy. He was neither the administrator nor did he send a single message that instigated violence.‚Äù He argued that the independent review committee last reviewed the material of the investigation as per Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act on August 4, 2020, after which over 400 witnesses were examined by police. ‚ÄúEvery so-called evidence against me has been collected after this date. If the exercise of gathering evidence was not complete, no independent review should have been done‚Ä¶‚Äù The charges have not been framed and the trial will take a long time, and hence, he deserves to be granted bail, the lawyer said. Special public prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for police, opposed the bail plea, saying Rehman was arrested by the ACP concerned as required under UAPA. ‚ÄúThe requirement is not that once sanction has been obtained, beyond that date if material comes during further investigation, it cannot be relied upon by the prosecution,‚Äù he submitted.

18	"NEW DELHI: A city court on Monday granted bail to former Congress councillor Ishrat Jahan in a case related to the northeast Delhi riots in which she was booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat said even if it was accepted that she had connectivity with the other accused, yet the fact remained that she was neither physically present during the riots nor was she part of any group, organisation or WhatsApp groups. Her name didn‚Äôt crop up in calls, CCTV footage or in any conspiratorial meetings. ‚ÄúThe entire conspiracy as spelt out in the chargesheet for the limited purpose of bail application on prima facie considerations persuades this court to allow the application for bail despite the embargoes in CrPC and UAPA,‚Äù said the court, adding that it was not the case of the prosecution that she was giving directions to the other accused to contend that her position and conspiracy was bigger than others. The court granted Jahan relief since filing of her bail application in September last year. This is the first bail granted by a trial court in the matter. She was in judicial custody for two years. She was directed to furnish a bail bond of Rs 50,000 with two sureties of like amount. It was noted that though, as per the chargesheet, Jahan was involved in the protest site at Khureji, it was not located in northeast Delhi. The court further said the arguments of the Special Public Prosecutor was that the entire northeast Delhi was surrounded from all sides and roads were blocked, but this did not happen at Khureji. The accused was not the one who created the idea of ‚Äúchakka jam‚Äù. However, the judge said the order did not discharge her from the case. Jahan was directed not to leave Delhi without prior permission of the court and not tamper with evidence. During the bail hearing, advocate Pradeep Teotia, appearing for Jahan, had alleged that the prosecution just wanted to derive ‚Äúsadistic pleasure‚Äù by increasing her custody by arguing that her bail plea was not maintainable. He also claimed that UAPA charges were slapped against her to stifle her voice. Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for police, had claimed that the bail plea was not maintainable as it was filed under the wrong provision. Teotia had said that the prosecution knew it from before that the bail plea was filed Section 439 CrPC, but didn‚Äôt point it out earlier. "
19	"NEW DELHI: Delhi Police opposed the bail plea of former JNU student leader Umar Khalid on Tuesday, saying that the ""ultimate objective"" of the riots conspiracy was to bring the government of India to its knees and destabilize the foundation of democracy. Khalid and several others have been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), a stringent anti-terror law, and are accused of being the ""masterminds"" of the riots which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured in 2020. The arguments on their bail pleas have been going on for more than five months. Opposing his bail plea before Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat, Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) Amit Prasad contested the claims of former JNU student leader Umar Khalid that the investigating agency was communal and the charge sheet in the riots conspiracy case was a ""figment of imagination"". Representing the police, the SPP said: ""The ultimate objective was to overthrow the government and undermine the authority of the parliament, which enacted the Citizenship (Amendment) Act CAA and destabilize the very foundation of the democracy"".  ""The idea was to bring the government of India on its knees and enforce the withdrawal of CAA. It is not that I am making the statement. This is evident from the chats which clearly state that government has to be brought to its knees"", he said.  Prasad further relied on the charge sheet to claim that the 2020 riots were not a spontaneous outburst of violence.  ""From the charge sheet, we have demonstrated that 23 protest sites were created and those sites were not organic in nature. They were meticulously planned with the location which was in close proximity to the masjids (Mosques),"" he said.  ""Multiple teams were formed to monitor these sites, give logistic supports, there were remote supervisors, local leaders, people who were visiting. We have also demonstrated the use of identical placards and banners at different protest sites which clearly shows that they were not organic and created in a coordinated manner,"" he added.  Prasad said the protests were not woman-dominated, rather they were managed by menfolk, and protest sites were swelled by bringing in women from the outside.  ""We have also demonstrated from the charge sheet that there was a clear interrelation between December 2019 riots and the February 2020 one. A similar pattern of crime was followed - blocking of roads attacking police, destructing properties, and violence with public and police,"" he said.  The charge sheet disclosed that 53 people died, he said, adding that 101 police officers and 41 public persons were injured in the first phase of riots in December 2019. In the second phase, 132 police officers and 76 public persons were injured.  ""There was clearly a case of death and injuries to persons. Total damage and claim settlement amount to Rs 21.93 crore. 61 claims have been settled and more are yet to be settled,"" the SPP said.  The investigation in the case revealed that firearms, petrol bombs, acid attacks, sticks, iron rods, stone-pelting through pre-fabricated large-sized slingshots were used to attack and kill police personnel, government employees, and public persons, he added.  Prasad further said that Khalid, through his lawyer, focused on ""irrelevant materials"" while arguing his bail application in a bid to divert the court's attention.  ""He (Umar) wants his application to be decided with reference to a web series and present case to be equated with 'The Family Man' or 'The Trial of the Chicago 7'. You do not have something on merit, you want to divert the attention of the court, focus on irrelevant materials, you want to go on media trial, create headlines,"" the SPP said.  On September 3, 2021, Khalid, through senior advocate Trideep Paid, said that the charge sheet in the case read like a script from a web-series 'The Family Man' and news channels. The lawyer also gave a reference to Voldemort, a villain in Harry Potter movies, to draw parallels between the statements in the chargesheet. Again on December 9, he referred to 'The Trial of the Chicago 7' in the courtroom.  On this, the SPP said, ""To equate the riots where 53 lives were lost with a web series is unfortunate. He does not want to refer to the law laid down by the constitutional courts. The idea is that you create a public perception. You want to refer to something which is relevant in media and not the law. The entire submission has been made on surmises and conjectures.""  He further emphasized that the court cannot go on a speculative analysis.  Besides this, Prasad opposed the alleged claims made by Khalid that the investigation agency and the investigating officer are communal.  ""I do not appreciate my learned friend arguing that the investigation agency and the Investigating officer are communal. The investigation agency is not of a particular person, it's of a state. The first conviction in the riots case was that of a Hindu. To say that investigation agency is communal does not go well,"" he submitted.  In the last hearing, Umar, through his lawyer, said that advocacy against a law like the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is not a crime and that the police pressured the witnesses to give statements against him.

20	"NEW DELHI: The official death toll in northeast Delhi‚Äôs riots rose to 42 on Friday with four more people dying at Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital. The Jumma prayers, meanwhile, passed off peacefully. Policemen and paramilitary forces kept a close watch, with drones deployed above, during the 10 hours of section 144 being relaxed. The police are, however, still looking for AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, booked in the murder case of IB official Ankit Sharma. His mobile phone has been switched off and a man who was coordinating with the media on his behalf claimed he has not been in touch with him as well. On Friday, a forensic team, along with members of SIT, inspected the drain from where Sharma‚Äôs body had been recovered.

Of these, 16 people have been identified and 12 are unknown. Seven had gunshot injuries, eight had blunt assault wounds, three had been stabbed, five had suffered burns, one had been stabbed and shot while the cause in four cases was unknown. He added that about 50 injured people were still in the hospital. Lok Nayak Hospital has recorded three deaths and another death has been reported from Jag Pravesh Chandra Hospital in east Delhi‚Äôs Shahdara. Dr Kishore Singh, medical director of Lok Nayak Hospital, said 56 injured people had been brought there in the past four days. One of them was brought dead while two died during treatment. Eleven people are still in hospital, he said. ‚ÄúOn Monday, when the riots began and patients started pouring in with serious injuries, there was some chaos. But within a day, a system was put in place for smooth triaging ‚Äì deciding the order of treatment ‚Äì depending on seriousness of the injuries and to manage the manpower needs. Some of the staffers who were on leave were asked to join immediately,‚Äù said a senior nursing staff at GTB Hospital. This hospital, with 2,500 beds, is the largest in east Delhi. Due to its proximity to the areas where maximum violence took place, most of the injured were rushed to the hospital beginning Monday. A senior official in the state health department said Wednesday onwards, when GTB Hospital‚Äôs emergency wing was running to near-full capacity, some of the patients with minor injuries were referred to Jag Pravesh Chandra and other hospitals. ‚ÄúNow, the government has also clarified that it will bear the cost of treatment for those injured in the riots even if they are being treated at private facilities,‚Äù he pointed out.

He had begun his arguments on the bail plea on August 23. Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad will commence the arguments on the behalf of police on January 5, 2022.

23	"NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday vowed to ensure punishment for those responsible for the Delhi riots irrespective of their religion, caste and political affiliation, asserting that action against the culprits would go down as an example for future rioters across the country. ‚ÄúI convey my condolences to all those who have lost their family members. I promise that none of the guilty will be spared no matter which religion, caste or political party they belong to. Delhi Police will act with such firmness that these riots will become a case study of the consequences that should visit those engage in riots,‚Äù Shah told Lok Sabha after an over five-hour debate on communal violence in the Capital. Home minister Amit Shah said the government wants to set up a claims commission to recover damages from rioters, and the Delhi high court has already been approached for the purpose. ‚ÄúAbout 700 FIRs have been filed, 152 weapons used in violence seized and 49 cases lodged under the Arms Act. Also, 2,647 people have been detained or arrested so far,‚Äù Shah said. Congress walked out of the House during the reply, provoking a sharp response from the usually quiet highways minister Nitin Gadkari. Responding to attacks from Congress which demanded his resignation and others in the opposition, Shah strongly rebutted the charges of failure and police inaction, saying the communal violence that claimed 53 lives was a pre-planned, well-organised conspiracy executed with hawala funds. ‚ÄúThe spread of riots on such a big scale in such a short time is not possible without a conspiracy. We have registered a case of conspiracy to probe this angle. Three people have been arrested for financing the violence in northeast Delhi,‚Äù he said. A combative Shah marshalled details to refute that Delhi police, which works under the home ministry, had failed, saying that riots had been controlled within 36 hours and were not allowed to spread beyond 12 police stations. ‚ÄúThe first complaint of riot was reported at 2 pm on February 24. It goes to the credit of the force that not a single incident of rioting took place after 11 pm on February 25,‚Äù he said. Shah said it was an achievement considering that northeast district had the highest population density in the country, was marked by a maze of narrow lanes and had a historically high crime rate. ‚ÄúIt borders UP from where 300 criminals were brought in as part of a sinister conspiracy to organise violence during the visit of US President Donald Trump,‚Äù he added. The minister focused on the role of social media in what has been dubbed the first ‚Äúdigitised riots‚Äù. ‚ÄúMore than 60 social media accounts were created specifically to incite communal violence between February 22 and 26,‚Äù he added. Shah said many of the social media accounts were since shut but police were looking for those responsible. ‚ÄúIf they feel that they will get away, they are mistaken, law will take its course,‚Äù he said, adding that 25 cases under the IT Act had been registered. He responded to the charge that the Union government failure to take action against BJP members who made ‚Äúprovocative speeches‚Äù by referring to speeches of AIMIM‚Äôs Waris Pathan and others to say that inflammatory comments defined anti-CAA protests. He also mentioned the ‚Äúaar-paar ki ladai‚Äù comment Sonia Gandhi had made at Ramlila Maidan, although he did not name the Congress chief. The minister stressed that riots were not a spontaneous outbreak. Responding to the allegation that the Centre delayed debate in Parliament, he said the government wanted the riots to be discussed after Holi to avoid communal flare-up during festival time. ‚ÄúThere has been a history of communal clashes during Holi. It seems others had other priorities,‚Äù he said. He refused the demand for a community-wise break-up of fatalities and said, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt give figures in ‚ÄòHindu-Muslim‚Äô as has been demanded by some members. 53 Indians have died, 526 Indians have been injured. Shops of 371 Indians were set ablaze and houses of 142 Indians were burned.‚Äù Shah also denied that he was missing in action. ‚ÄúI was in Ahmedabad on February 24 because the public reception for the visiting US President had been organised in my constituency. I came back the same evening and stayed away from Trump‚Äôs reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan, and the banquet organised for him to concentrate on the deployment of security forces,‚Äù he said.

24	"NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has dismissed an 80-year-old man‚Äôs plea seeking a declaration of his son‚Äôs death, allegedly killed during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, saying he has produced no document to prove that his son even existed. The court said it is a matter of common and legal sense that only a person known to have existed in the first place can be declared dead. The man had approached the court seeking declaration of civil death of his son Ajit Singh and procuring/issuance of a death certificate from the office of the concerned registrar of births and deaths. ‚ÄúNeedless to say, before seeking a declaration that a person is dead, plaintiff had the onus to prove the existence of Ajit Singh, who is the ‚Äòperson‚Äô sought to be declared dead. On the contrary, despite a query by the court during final arguments, the plaintiff did not bring on record any ID proof of Ajit Singh nor any document which could reasonably satisfy the court about his identity and existence,‚Äù Civil Judge Helly Fur Kaur said in an order on Thursday. The court noted that it was an admitted fact that no missing report was available with the man since the police allegedly refused to register the same. The one lodged with Delhi administration was misplaced. According to the suit filed by the man, his son allegedly went missing during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots and his efforts to trace him failed. He submitted that it is trite law that a person who has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of if he had been alive should be presumed dead. The suit said it was incumbent to submit here that the plaintiff‚Äôs son had not been heard by anyone among the family/relatives/ friends since the riots, so his son was presumed and declared dead. It further said that in any event, for issuance of a death certificate and for seeking compensation, the plaintiff needs to obtain a declaration of civil death of his son. "

26	"NEW DELHI: The investigation into the death of intelligence official Ankit Sharma, according to multiple sources, indicates that there was a strong possibility of it being a ""targeted killing"" and not a random act of violence. The police have pieced together an initial sequence of events. Sharma had returned from office around 5pm on February 25 and stepped out with his friends. He, along with his friend, Kalu, and a few others were on one side of a 'pulia' (small bridge) while heavy stone-pelting was on from the other side. Sharma was at the front.  Eyewitnesses have told police that Sharma tripped over a stone and fell. Three-four men came from the other side and overpowered Sharma, who was then dragged away to the other side. ""Curiously, they did not touch anyone else but him,"" said a source. Sharma was possibly taken to a confined location (a house) as nobody saw him after. That's where he is suspected to have been stripped and brutalised. His body was then dragged to the drain and dumped. The body, which had only undergarments on it, was fished out from the drain the next day.  The intelligence establishment - after analysing the prima facie sequence of events, some statements and initial medical opinion - is convinced that Sharma's death appeared to be a murder with a motive. ""The sequence indicates that the killers may have been trying to send across a message. This is bigger than what meets the eye,"" a senior intelligence officer told TOI on Wednesday. While the exact number of injuries on his body are not clear yet, doctors conducting the post-mortem had told a cop present there that it had at least 54 deep stab wounds.  Talking about 'targeted killing' becoming the strongest line of probe, an investigator said: ""The fact that Sharma was abducted and taken away and not killed or harmed at the spot by the mob had raised suspicion at first. The theory has only been strengthened as the sequence of events has become clearer. Vengeance is clearly visible by the condition of the body. Nobody is killed like this usually by a mob,"" he added.  Asked if they had any leads on suspects, a senior police officer said they were trying to identify the people who dragged him away based on the details of their appearance as recalled by eyewitnesses. ""Leads from technical surveillance in the area is awaited. We are also trying to trace a group of Bangladeshi criminals whose location has come in the area around that time,"" he added.

Police clubbed Aliís complaint with another FIR (no. 72/ 2020) registered on the complaint of one Naresh Chand regarding the burning of his house, in which Ali was named as an accused, thus making Ali also a complainant. Court: Strange that complainant in riot case an accused tooAli was arrested in the case but subsequently got bail. Following this, he approached the magistrate court seeking registration of a separate FIR, which was allowed when police told the court that FIR 72/2020 had Aliís complaint too. Police challenged this before the sessions court and informed that they had already filed an FIR (no. 55/ 2020) in the Madina Masjid arson case before Ali had approached the court. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav said police were not even aware that an FIR had already been registered at Karawal Nagar police station when Ali approached the magistrate court. ""This prima facie reflects the callous attitude/negligence on the part of the investigating agency, as it was incumbent upon it to have placed complete material before the learned additional chief metropolitan magistrate (North East). This court is quite pained to see the lackadaisical attitude adopted by the investigating agency in the matter,"" added the order. Noting that the magistrate court had not committed any flaw as its order to file an FIR on Aliís complaint was based on insufficient material, the sessions court remanded back the case to it to consider the matter afresh. The sessions court also noted that it was ""really strange"" that Ali was not only the complainant in FIR 72/2020, but also an accused, which was an ""apparent absurdity"". Advocate M R Shamshad, appearing for Ali, claimed that various wrong status reports were submitted before the court and police had disclosed the second FIR (55/ 2020) exactly a year later. "

After he came out Mishra said that he only came to file a complaint against people who according to him are running a campaign against him in the northeast Delhi riots case. ""When the Delhi Police is filing charge sheets, when the rioters are being arrested at this time there is a section which is running a hate campaign against me and trying to save the real conspirators and that is why I came to the Special Cell office to file a complaint so that these people could be investigated,"" Mishra said. Asked if the police also questioned him regarding his role in the northeast Delhi riots, he said that the police has already questioned him and these details are already in the charge sheets. BJP leader Mishra was questioned in the last week of July by the Delhi Police Special Cell in connection with the northeast Delhi riots, where he claimed that he had gone to the area to ""resolve the situation"", that he gave ""no speech"", and that remarks made by him standing next to a DCP were only meant to convey his intention of launching a 'dharna' to counter anti-CAA protesters. These details find a mention in a charge sheet filed by the Delhi Police before Delhi's Karkardooma court last week. In a video tweeted by him on February 23 - a day before riots broke out in northeast Delhi - Mishra can be seen addressing a pro-CAA gathering near the Maujpur traffic signal and standing next to DCP (North East) Ved Prakash Surya. He can be seen saying, ""They (protesters) want to create trouble in Delhi. That's why they have closed the roads. That is why they have created a riot-like situation here. We have not pelted stones. The DCP is standing in front of us and on your behalf, I want to tell him that till the US President (Donald Trump) is in India, we are leaving the area peacefully. After that, we won't listen to you (police) if the roads are not vacated by then. We will have to take to the streets."" Violence broke out in northeast Delhi on February 24 between CAA supporters and protesters and spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured. "
30	"NEW DELHI: The special investigating team probing the violence that occurred during the anti-CAA protests has found that at least 15 criminals, who are Bangladeshis, were involved in the clashes that took place in Seemapuri on December 20. Sources said all of them were staying illegally in JJ colonies on the city‚Äôs borders. The Bangladeshis were earlier arrested for carrying out burglaries. Police sources said they have been identified and will be arrested soon. The SIT will now be probing who funded the protests as it suspects a foreign hand in it. The team will also visit Tihar Jail to interrogate the arrested rioters. During the Seemapuri riots, a group protesting at the Delhi-Ghaziabad border suddenly turned violent and started pelting stones at parked vehicles. When police tried to intervene, the mob chased after the handful of cops and threw stones and broken bottles at them. The SIT is probing whether there was a common link between all the riots. They are also trying to find out the source from which such huge gatherings at Seelampur and Daryaganj were mobilised. Some of the WhatsApp groups through which the youths were mobilised are being scanned to identify who motivated them. It has been found that the riots were spearheaded by a handful of people. Efforts are on to establish whether they were the same set of people involved in sparking all instances of violence at Seelampur, Seemapuri and Daryaganj. The analysis of the rumours circulated to fan the riots indicated at a well thought out strategy of someone who had been watching the developments from a distance. Police were shocked to find rioters already carrying stones and Molotov cocktails when they had reached the spot. "

Two bodies were pulled out from the drain that runs through Bhagirathi Vihar in Gokulpuri and another from a drain in Shiv Vihar. ‚ÄúNone of the three bodies has been identified.

On Sunday evening, their were reports of a man being beaten up by a group of people in the inner lanes of Bhajanpura. While the victim, Basant Jha, has not filed a complaint with Delhi Police as he is a resident of Ghaziabad, his brother told TOI that he had received injuries and his car was damaged. Jha who was travelling from Bawana to Ghaziabad was allegedly stopped by a group and beaten up with an iron rod. ‚ÄúThe incident took place between 4 pm and 5pm. My brother works in the hardware sector and had gone to Bawana buy some material. When he was returning, some of the main roads leading towards Ghaziabad were barricaded.

Meanwhile, the SIT team is focusing on murder cases first. Once investigation of these cases is streamlined, the probe will move on to other violent and assault cases, an officer said. Cops have also been carrying out raids in search of suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, who has been booked in the murder case of Ankit Sharma, an IB official whose body was fished out from a drain. Police sources revealed that Tahir switched off his phone on February 27 at 10pm. His last location was near Dayalpur.

33	"BATHINDA: Hundreds of activists of 14 unions of farmers, farm labourers, youth and students held protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) in Bathinda on Wednesday. They said PM Narendra Modi-led Union government and Delhi Police were mute spectators to mobs attacking persons from the minority community, which resulted in killing of at least 22 people on both sides by Wednesday. The protesters claimed that happenings in Delhi were no less than the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. The protesters demanded registration of cases against perpetrators of crimes and compensation of Rs 10 lakh to families of all deceased. On a call given by these organisations, effigies of the Union government were burnt at 46 places in 15 districts of Punjab. Many protesters held pictures of martyr Bhagat Singh and said freedom fighters would have never dreamt that such senseless sectarian violence would happen in India and even religious places of a particular community would be targeted by vandals. Farm labour organisation Punjab Khet Mazdoor Union state general secretary Lachhman Singh Sewewala said the happenings in Delhi were ìvery disturbingî. ìAgain, the same is being practised and members of minority community are being targeted. This will dent the secular image of India,î he said. Farmer organisation BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) president Buta Singh Burjgill and general secretary Jagmohan Singh said they were with Muslims of Delhi who had been made to face harrowing times. ìWe will never tolerate such attacks on minority communities. Our protests will continue on Thursday,î Buta said. "
34	"GURUGRAM: About 100 km from the seat of the Delhi riots, Mewat's 'Shaheen Bagh' is feeling the heat.  ""Things have changed since Delhi was allowed to burn,"" said Salamuddin, a lawyer and president of the Mewat Vikas Sabha.  The peaceful protest at Badkali Chowk against CAA, NRC and NPR began exactly a month ago, on the death anniversary of Gandhi. All of Mewat has been under Section 144 for about two months now, but the protest continues. The makeshift tent has been put together by locals just a little ahead of Badkali Chowk, sectioned into halves for women and men. It started with a handful of people holding readings of the Constitution, poetry and ghazals. By now, about 1,500 attend the protest every day. While the stir expanded by the day, police had not tried to clear the protest site - some cops said everything had been peaceful and they saw no reason to take action - until now. ""As pressure builds up elsewhere, the administration here has also been growing apprehensive. They have been asking us to end the protest. But we are determined to press on,"" Salamuddin said.  The middle ground they have reached is this - no speaker from outside will be invited for a week or so, and all speeches will be screened. ""No matter what happens in Delhi, we will not allow that to spill over here. There is no space for hatred,"" said Mohammed Sabir Qasmi, president of Jamiat Ulama e Hind's Gurugram unit. Atif, a young protester, said many in his family live in areas that were torched during the riots in north-east Delhi. ""Some of them fled from Hauz Rani and Shiv Vihar. They have been forced to abandon everything they have known, their houses and mosques razed to the ground - but they don't blame anyone. They have been asking us not to fall for hate speech,"" he added. Closer home, a fringe outfit, Hindu Sena, has unleashed an inflammatory campaign in Gurugram. But protesters are determined to keep that rhetoric out of the demonstration space here. ""We want action against politicians who incite violence and force minorities to flee their homes. But we don't want our people here to get instigated. We will go by what Gandhi and Ambedkar said and keep peace. We read their works here every day,"" said Atif. Every day, around 10am, the spot comes alive with the national anthem played on speakers. By noon, people from areas nearby flock to the protest, national flags and posters of Gandhi and Ambedkar in hand. They read the paper, perform skits and debate the political nuances of the law they are opposing. The day ends, again, with the national anthem. ""We want harmony. The point of our protest is to preserve that. We are not against anyone, nor is anyone against us,"" said Qasmi.  In keeping with the spirit of the protests that inspired them, it's women at the forefront of the Badkali Chowk protest too. ""Women have been leading our protest. Some who never spoke a word in the presence of men are addressing large gatherings. Young girls recite nazms, relate their experiences and give speeches,"" said Salamuddin.  And what do they speak of? ""Our girls talk about the schools they never got, the safety they never had and the fears they always live with. They find it liberating,"" said a 65-year-old woman. "
35	"NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court has granted bail to two persons, facing prosecution in a case of murder and criminal conspiracy relating to last year's northeast Delhi riots. Justice Suresh Kumar Kait noted that the accused Pradeep Rai and Aman Kashyap are in judicial custody and the trial shall take substantial time. However, without commenting on the merit of the case, the court said it was of the opinion that the two men deserve bail. The high court directed that the two accused be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 20,000 each with one surety of like amount. It directed them not to directly or indirectly influence any prosecution witnesses. The two men are accused in an FIR lodged at Dayalpur police station in northeast Delhi for offences of murder, rioting and criminal conspiracy under the IPC. The counsel of the accused submitted that one of the eyewitnesses in the case is an eyewitness in multiple FIRs lodged at Dayalpur police station relating to the riots incident that took place on February 25, last year. He said the incidents took place in Gali no. 10 and 3 and there is a distance of around 500-700 metres between them and therefore, he seemed to be a planted witness. The high court had directed the prosecution to verify as to how the concerned witness had witnessed the incidents which took place in different lanes. After verification, the prosecution filed a report stating that the distance between Gali no.10 and Gali no.3 is about 350 metres. To this, the high court said, ìIn the prima facie opinion of this court, it is possible that the eye witness, who in the present case is resident of Gali no.8, might have seen the incident taking place in Gali No.10, which is close to his place, but how he could see the present incident which has taken place in Gali No.3, and away from Gali no.10 and Gali no.8, is doubtful.î Earlier, the trial court had dismissed the bail pleas of the two men saying the eye witness' statements cannot be thrown into the dustbin merely on the bleak allegations that they are ìplanted witnessesî. Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 last year after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protestors spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured.

36	"NEW DELHI: The Delhi police on Friday filed its first chargesheet in a court in connection with recent riots in northeast Delhi accusing Shahrukh Pathan, arrested in a case related to Jaffarabad area, of trying to kill head-constable Deepak Dahiya and others by firing at them on February 24. The final report of over 350 pages charged the accused with attempt to murder, rioting, obstructing public servant in discharge of public function and assaulting or using criminal force to deter public servant from discharging his duty. In the charge sheet, besides the provisions of the Indian Penal Code, Delhi Police have also invoked the provisions of the Arms Act against the accused. If convicted, Shahrukh may get a maximum of 10 years jail and will also be liable for a fine. The FIR in the case was lodged on February 26. Shahrukh was arrested by Narcotics Cell, Crime on March 3 and is in jail. He was the first person to be arrested in the riot cases. During investigation, one Kaleem Ahmad, a resident of Kairana, Uttar Pradesh, who had given shelter to the accused Shahrukh, was also arrested in this case. Section 216 (Harbouring offender who has escaped from custody or whose apprehension has been ordered) and other provisions of IPC were also added against the accused person during the course of probe, police said. Besides Shaharukh Pathan and Kaleem Ahmad, the name of one Ishtiyak Mallik, a resident of Arvind Nagar, Ghonda, Delhi whose location was also found at the spot, also appears as accused. According to police, the weapon of offence, a 7.65 mm pistol and 2 live rounds, were recovered from Shahrukh in the case. Pathan, 23, whose picture showing him pointing a gun at unarmed Delhi Police head constable Deepak Dahiya during the communal riots went viral on social media, was arrested from Uttar Pradesh's Shamli district. After opening fire, he kept the pistol at home and fled from the city in a car, police said. In the viral video, Pathan, a resident of northeast Delhi's Ghonda, could be seen pointing his pistol at the policeman on the Jaffrabad-Maujpur road on February 24. Police said after seeing himself on news channels following the incident, Pathan changed his clothes and fled to Punjab. He then moved to Bareilly in UP before hiding at a friend's house in Shamli in the state. The good quality semi-automatic pistol used by Pathan was bought from Munger in Bihar, according to police. A college dropout, Pathan was interested in body building and modelling. He used to make TikTok videos. He owns a shop and a socks manufacturing factory in Ghonda. The case was lodged under various provisions of the IPC including section 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), section 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and section 307 (attempt to murder), sections 147 and 148 (both related to rioting).

""The material on record and the investigating agency's status report do not disclose the commission of the offences under the UAPA, 1967, except the bald statements of the witnesses,"" a single judge bench of the high court comprising Justice Suresh Kumar Kait noted while granting bail to Khan. The bench also said that there is no proof on record such as CCTV footage, video clip or chat record of the petitioner with any of the group, except the allegation that he provided SIM card on a fake ID in December 2019 and took a small amount of Rs 200 for the same. ""It is not the case of the prosecution that he provided many SIM cards and continued to do the same. It is also not the case of the prosecution that he was part of any chat group or part of any group which conspired to commit offence as alleged in the present case,"" the bench said. The court, while granting bail to the petitioner, directed him to submit a personal bail bond of Rs 25,000 with one surety of the like amount. ""I am of the view that the petitioner deserves bail,"" the bench said. The court noted that for invoking the UAPA against the petitioner, it is the duty of the investigating agency to demonstrate that the petitioner had ""actual knowledge"" that the said SIM card would be used for organising protests. ""It was imperative for the investigating agency to demonstrate that the petitioner had 'active knowledge' about the utilisation of the said SIM card. It is not alleged that the petitioner was party to any such conspiracy to organise protests,"" the bench said. The court also observed that the petitioner voluntarily appeared before the agency for questioning and did not evade or flee between the period of registration of the FIR (March 6) and the date of his arrest (July 29). ""This is material fact shows that the petitioner has fully cooperated with the probe and had made himself available as and when directed by the investigating agency,"" the bench noted. The court also directed that the petitioner shall not directly or indirectly influence any witness or tamper with the evidence. ""The trial court shall not get influenced by the observation made by this court while passing the order in the present petition,"" it said.

The Delhi Police has taken several steps to control the law and order situation in the national capital, Union minister of state for home Nityanand Rai said in Lok Sabha in a written reply. Police officers along with adequate force, including 76 companies (7,600 personnel) of the Central Armed Police Forces, were deployed at vulnerable points, he said. ""More than 120 FIRs have been lodged and hundreds of miscreants have been arrested. Investigating Officers are collecting CCTV footage and seeking out videos from public to bring the guilty to book.

Rai said prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Criminal Penal Code (CrPC) are being imposed in riot-hit areas. Police forces have conducted flag marches in these areas to instill confidence among people. Appeal has been made to people to maintain peace and not to believe rumours. Meetings of local peace committees, resident welfare associations, market welfare associations, civil society groups, representatives of political parties etc have been held in the affected areas, he said.

40	"NEW DELHI: Investigation in cases of riots often hits a roadblock due to lack of evidence. It becomes even more difficult to ascertain the correct sequence of events, let alone identifying the rioters. However, thanks to the video footage available with them, Delhi Police is sure that the perpetrators of the recent riots will be brought to books. Apart from the CCTV footage from the affected areas, mobile videos shot by the residents have also helped the cops join the missing dots and place a verified sequence on record. Soon after formation of the SIT in the riots, Delhi Police had appealed to people to share whatever video evidence they had recorded during the riots. According to additional commissioner, Mandeep Singh Randhawa, Delhi Police has till date received as many as 2,162 videos from public. Police are carefully examining the authenticity of the videos before using them to identify the rioters, said a source. ìThe videos are carefully examined for any tampering by our video experts and then inventoried and categorised based on areas and case FIRs,î he added. Of the 2,162 videos received, police have filtered out only 1,330 usable videos. Many of the videos received were similar too. ìAfter categorisation, the videos are manually analysed by showing them to locals and informers. They are then run through a software, which uses facial recognition technology, to identify the suspects.î Police are also selecting the videos sent by people who had recorded them themselves on their mobile phones. ""These videos are being sent for forensic analysis and can be used as an evidence in the court as well. Forwarded videos can aide in investigation, but not be placed on record in court,î a senior cop said. From the sensational murders of head constable Ratan Lal to the killing of IB official Ankit Sharma - the videos have played a crucial role during the probe. The mystery of four bodies recovered from the drains in northeast Delhi was largely solved using the video footage. Police had also managed to solve the case of arson at a house, in which a 85-year-old woman died of asphyxia, using video footage. "
41	"NEW DELHI: A separate FIR has been filed by Special Cell of Delhi Police to probe the ìlarger conspiracyî behind the riots in northeast Delhi. Police have invoked the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), apart from IPC sections on criminal conspiracy and sedition. Jamia Millia Islamia students Meeran Haidar and Safoora Zargar were first arrested by northeast district police and then by Special Cell through this FIR. Seven others, including activists like Gulfisha and Khalid Saifi, have been arrested in this case taking the number of accused to nine. Six of the nine accused, including Haidar and Zargar, are now booked under UAPA. They have also been booked for sedition and promoting enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion and rioting. Former Jawaharlal Nehru University student Umar Khalid, who is already facing trial for sedition in the Afzal Guru commemoration event of 2016, is also under probe in this FIR for his hate speeches given against Citizenship Amendment Act, a senior officer said. Haider and Zargar, who are members of Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC), are in judicial custody. While Haider is a PhD student and president of RJD youth wingís in Delhi, Zargar is an MPhil student at Jamia and the media coordinator of JCC. The communal riots, which broke out on February 23, led to the deaths of over 50 people. Police in northeast district have filed close to 750 FIRs in connection with the riots and have arrested many on charges of murder and attempted murder. The cases are now being probed by the Crime Branch. The Special Cellís FIR has been lodged on a tip-off from intelligence agencies and inputs obtained by the special branch. The case has been lodged on the statement of a Special Cell sleuth saying that the communal violence was fallout of a ìpremeditated conspiracyî. A probe is on in Khalidís two extremely provocative speeches in which he allegedly appealed to people to block the roads during the visit of US President Donald Trump to make treatment of minorities in India an international issue. According to the latest FIR, the accused were assigned responsibilities to congregate people from different areas and make women and children block the roads under Jafrabad metro station to fuel tension in the area. This was something that reportedly triggered the riots. The FIR also focuses on the preparations for the riots that saw massive use of firearms, Molotov cocktails, acid bottles, bricks and stones.

Qureshi, who was arrested by the southwestern range of the Special Cell on Thursday, has reportedly told the cops that he was present in the area with his friend Sameer. Around 2pm, he saw violence had broken out in the area and decided to join in. He told cops they mingled in the crowd and started throwing stones at people from the other community who had gathered on the other side of the Pulia. In the meantime, Qureshi picked up a knife kept near the stall of a sweet shop and stood on the road near the residence of suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, a source said. Hussain, along with his brother Shah Alam, has been arrested on the charges of hatching a conspiracy that led to Sharma‚Äôs murder. After walking around for some time, Qureshi saw that a group of 20-30 people had been dragging a person from the other side of the Pulia to this side, said the source. Qureshi claimed he didn‚Äôt know the man‚Äôs identity. As he rushed towards the group, police claimed, he saw the mob brutally thrashing the man with sticks, stones and other objects and stabbed the person three times and also kicked him. He apparently told the cops that as the man stopped responding after a few minutes, they picked up his body and threw it in the drain. The next day ‚Äî when Sharma‚Äôs body was recovered from the Chand Bagh drain ‚Äî Qureshi identified the man from the photograph being shown on the television and went underground. He was nabbed by a Special Cell team led by DCP Sanjeev Yadav, who had formed a team comprising of ACP Sanjay Dutt and inspectors Atul Tyagi and Dalip Kumar to work on technical intelligence. By deploying sources on the ground to develop the electronic leads, the team zeroed in on Qureshi, whose location was found to be around the spot where Sharma was killed. The Special Cell is hoping to identify other killers with the help of Qureshi, who has been remanded in police custody. "

45	"NEW DELHI: A man accused of rioting in northeast Delhi in February was granted bail by a Delhi court on the ground that he was identified by a police constable much later after the incident. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav‚Äôs order called it prima facie a ‚Äúvery weak‚Äù evidence. ‚ÄúIf the constable was present at the time of the riots at the spot and had identified the applicant as one of the rioters, then the least he should have done was to report him at the police station. But he didn‚Äôt. His naming the applicant in his statement on March 7 is a very weak evidence,‚Äù it said. The constable, in his statement, had named Ahmed and two others accusing them of unlawful assembly and causing damage to a school. Seeking bail for the accused, Ahmed, advocate Abdul Gaffar argued that though the incident took place on February 25, the FIR had been registered on March 5 and his client was arrested on March 16. ‚ÄúThe applicant is not named in the FIR. There is no CCTV footage in which he can be seen. There is no call data record (CDR) of the applicant. He has been arrested merely on the basis of constable Piyush‚Äôs statement,‚Äù Gaffar argued. Special public prosecutor DK Bhatia claimed that the delay in filing of the FIR was owing to the rampant nature of riots and curfew-like situation in the area. ‚ÄúThe situation attained normalcy only in the first week of March. Thereafter, complainants started reporting to police,‚Äù he argued. Bhatia added that Piyush was the area‚Äôs beat constable and knew Ahmed resided there. The court held that after Ahmed‚Äôs arrest, the investigating officer should have got his judicial test identification parade conducted. ‚ÄúThe applicant is admittedly not seen in any CCTV footage. His CDR locations are also not there on record,‚Äù it added. "
46	"LUCKNOW: Aam Aadmi Party MP Sanjay Singh demanded a probe monitored by Supreme Court or high court into Delhi riots and said he would raise the matter in Parliament on Monday and ask for setting up a joint parliamentary committee for an inquiry into the outbreak of violence which left 43 people dead. Speaking to reporters in Lucknow on Sunday, the Rajya Sabha MP said that preparations for large scale violence had been made before Delhi elections. ‚ÄúBJP members had been inciting people with provocative speeches and the violence would have taken place before Delhi election had our party not flagged off the matter. Outsiders were brought from Loni and west UP to carry out violence, which is why AAP had demanded immediate closure of borders,‚Äù Singh said. On being told that an AAP councillor is accused of orchestrating violence and has been booked for murder, Singh said law will take its own course and demanded narco test of all members of all political parties and it should be telecast live. ‚ÄúIf one wants to find out the truth behind riots, who instigated them and indulged in violence, conduct narco test of BJP and AAP members and telecast it live on TV. It will reveal who was behind violence,‚Äù he said. "
47	"BENGALURU: Insurers said, even though the normal window was 15 days for filing a claim, in case of riots they will make exceptions and all claims will be honoured. Both public and private-sector insurers cited, instances of vehicle damage and burnt vehicles in UP riots/CAA protests in October and November. ìThere is always a provision for condoning the delay of intimation, for claims covered under policy, in case of genuine circumstances,î said Atul Sahai, CEO, New India. Damage such as fire or looting, resulting from riots or civil disturbance is covered under standard policies for home insurance, business insurance and motor insurance. Insurers said they had mostly faced vehicle damage claims than property damage claims in UP and they expect the same situation in Delhi. This was not because there was less damage to property, but because less number of people had taken home and business protection insurance. With motor insurance being mandatory in India, vehicle damage formed the bulk of claims filed. In UP riots, insurers said some claims had come in nearly a month later, which they still honoured - as it had taken time for normalcy to be restored. ""We will of course take the ground situation into account and extend a certain grace period,"" said Sanjay Datta, chief underwriting claims, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Insurers also said that one's action or inaction during a riot is immaterial to payout of the claim. ""The policyholder can be in a hospital or jail, but the claim will still be honoured,"" said another insurer. "
