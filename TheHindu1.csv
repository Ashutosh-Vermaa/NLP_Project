0	"He wishes to maintain a sense of secrecy around him; he doesn’t want people to know who he is meeting and why; and he creates a charade while going about his day-to-day life.He is a 30-year-old protected witness (PW) in the conspiracy case of communal riots that broke out in the Capital in February 2020. A resident of north-east Delhi, he is among the protected witnesses who was not produced before the magistrate for recording his statement but his ‘statement to police’ was attached in the chargesheet. Speaking to The Hindu, the witness said the statement police have submitted is not his and he has not signed it either. “About five-six months after the riots, I was called by the police for the first time and the officer asked me general questions about my life and nothing about the riots. The second time they asked me some unusual questions such as what variety of mangoes I like to eat; and during the conversation they kept my phone with them. During the third interaction, they took away my phone. The fourth time, they called me and enquired about my relationship with the people who were in my contact list, and those who were arrested in the case,” he said. Next thing he knew, he was in the list of protected witnesses.
Caught unawares
 “I was not informed by the police that I have been made a PW. I never signed any statement. I never appeared in the court. I never gave any statement in the first place,” he said. The document police submitted in his name is a six/seven-page chronology of events which he read after it was submitted to the court, he added. Recalling the events that led to the riots, the 30-year-old said he was against the violence “from the beginning” and had even averted probable ruckus on four occasions starting mid-January 2020. “Outsiders had taken over the anti-CAA protests and they continued to say that we should do something big and we locals were always against it. I had stopped being an active part of the protests on January 22,” said the witness, who was vocal against the ideas of some of those arrested in the conspiracy case.
Mental trauma
 Being a ‘PW’ has impacted him emotionally and mentally in the last two years. “Very few people know that I have been made a PW. Mostly, people have known me for vehemently opposing the violence. I have been labeled by both sides of the extremes – the right and the left; Hindus and Muslims. Those who were my friends don’t stand with me now and I am facing a boycott,” he said. On February 29, 2020, he apparently received a random call from a woman who accused him of being integral to the planned protests in north-east Delhi. “I got so worried after that and left my home for few days and returned only when the frenzy subsided,” he said. “My parents remain worried. During the bail hearings there are instances when the arguments worry all of us and they keep offering prayers. I have been diagnosed with hypertension,” he said, anxious about what is ahead of me when the case goes to trial. “The investigation is poor. I don’t understand where I fit in the scheme of things”. Advocate Abdul Gaffar, who is defending several Delhi riots cases, said that writing statements for witnesses is a routine for the police so that the chargesheet can sustain in the court of law or “what suits the prosecution”, sometimes even with incorrect statements.  Communal riots broke out in February 2020 in north-east Delhi leaving over 50 people dead and countless injured. Police had arrested over 1,800 people in connection with 700-plus FIRs. An FIR registered on charges of criminal conspiracy is being probed by Delhi Police Special Cell and the chargesheet was submitted in court in September 2020."
1	" Opposing former JNU student leader Umar Khalid’s bail plea in the north-east Delhi riots “larger conspiracy” case, the prosecution on Friday sought to draw a parallel between the planning that went into the February
 2020 violence and the 9/11 terror attacks in the U.S.
 Referring to the defence arguments about Mr. Khalid’s case being similar to
The Trial of the Chicago 7 — a movie on the trial of seven defendants charged by the U.S. government with conspiracy after countercultural protests in Chicago in 1968 — Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) Amit Prasad said the 9/11 attacks were more relevant.
“Just before 9/11 happened, they [the accused] reached a particular place and took training. A month prior to that [9/11], they moved to their respective positions. That is what is relevant in this [Delhi riots] case also,” he submitted before Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat.He said the key conspirator of 9/11 had never visited the U.S. or Malaysia, where the plot was hatched, and then referred to the fact that despite conversations in the Delhi Protest Support Group pointing to a violent protest, Mr. Khalid continued to be part of the WhatsApp group and “remained silent”. The defence counsel had earlier argued that Mr. Khalid sent only five messages on the group.Amravati speech The prosecution also played Mr. Khalid’s Amravati speech of February 2020 and argued that he had attempted to create an “
aatank ka mahaul ” (feeling of terror) among Muslims. The SPP said at one point in his speech, Mr. Khalid used the term “We, Muslims” even though he claims to be an atheist.
Mr. Prasad said contrary to the public perception, the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protest sites that sprang up in the run-up to the riots were not “organic” and had been carefully “planned” beforehand. “The issue was not CAA-NRC… you had to somehow embarrass the government,” the prosecutor submitted, adding that the attempt was to create “a facade of secular protests”. The prosecution arguments will continue on January 29."
2	" A Delhi court on Thursday sentenced Dinesh Yadav, the first person convicted in connection with February 2020 riots, to five years in jail. Last month, Additional Sessions Judge Virender Bhat had convicted him for being part of a riotous mob that set a house on fire.This is the first sentencing in the riots cases. Yadav has also been directed to pay a fine of ?12,000, said advocate Shikha Garg, who had represented him during the trial. A detailed order on sentencing is awaited.As per the prosecution, Yadav was an “active member of the riotous mob” and participated in vandalizing and putting on fire the house of a 73-year-old woman named Manori on February 25 night. Ms. Manori had alleged that a mob of around 150-200 rioters attacked her house when her family was not present and looted all the articles and even the buffalo. The 25-year-old Yadav was arrested on June 8, 2020. The court framed charges against him on August 3, 2021, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. He was convicted on December 6. Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi in February 2020, after the violence between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and its protesters spiraled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured.

3	"The Delhi High Court has rejected the bail petition of a man arrested in connection with the death of a head constable during the northeast Delhi riots last year, noting that the incident was a result of a “pre-planned and pre-meditated conspiracy to disturb law and order in the city”.Justice Subramonium Prasad, while dismissing the bail plea of Mohd. Ibrahim, who was seen on numerous CCTV footages wearing a skull cap, black Nehru jacket and salwar-kurta and with a sword in his hand on multiple locations around Chand Bagh area. Also read:
Delhi riots: court pulls up police for 'callous' probeJustice Prasad said even though Mr. Ibrahim could not be seen at the ‘scene of crime’, he clearly was part of the mob for the sole reason that he had consciously travelled 1.6 km away from his neighbourhood with a sword, which could only be used to incite violence and inflict damage.“The riots which shook the National Capital of the country in February 2020 evidently did not take place in a spur of the moment, and the conduct of the protesters who are present in the video footage, which has been placed on record by the prosecution visibly portrays that it was a calculated attempt to dislocate the functioning of the government as well as to disrupt the normal life of the people in the city,” the court remarked.The systematic disconnection and destruction of CCTV cameras also confirmed the existence of a pre-planned and pre-meditated conspiracy to disturb law and order in the city, Justice Prasad said. “This is also evident from the fact that innumerable rioters ruthlessly descended with sticks, ‘dandas’, bats etc. upon a hopelessly outnumbered cohort of police officials”.Protest against CAAThe case relates to an FIR filed in connection with a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019 that had been taking place for 1.5 months prior to the incident at Khajuri Square to Loni Circle at Wazirabad Road, Chand Bagh, by the Muslim community.

Delhi riots: Court drops arson charges against 10, says police covering flawOn February 24, 2020, around 1.00 p.m. the protesters mobilised near the Chand Bagh area and 25 Futa Road, and moved towards the Main Wazirabad Road. When police attempted to convince them to not move forward, the protesters carrying sticks, baseball sticks, iron rods and stones turned violent.Some people in the crowd started pelting stones at the police officials, and beat them as well as other passers-by. The FIR stated that ACP Gokalpuri, head constable Ratan Lal and DCP Shahdara Amit Kumar were beaten with sticks and stones, and as a result, they fell down and suffered grievous head injuries. Later, the head constable died of a bullet injury.Died of gunshot injuryMr. Ibrahim’s counsel argued that as per the injury report, which was a part and parcel of the charge sheet, the death of the head constable was due to a gunshot injury and the same was possibly fired from the gun of a police official. The death had not been caused by the sword which was carried by Mr. Ibrahim, he said.Additional Solicitor General S.V. Raju, representing the Delhi Police, said the absence of an accused from a video did not translate into absence of the accused from the scene of crime. Identification of an accused in videography was a Herculean task, he noted.After perusing the material on record, the court said Mr. Ibrahim had been clearly identified on multiple CCTV footages, carrying a sword and instigating the crowd.The clinching evidence that tilted this court towards prolonging the incarceration of Mr. Ibrahim was the fact that the weapon which was being carried by him was capable of causing grievous injuries and/or death, and was prima facie a dangerous weapon, Justice Prasad noted.Bail for another arrestedOn Monday, in a separate decision on the same FIR, the court granted bail to Mohd. Saleem Khan, who was arrested on March 11, 2020. He was seen turning away a CCTV camera with the aid of a wiper.Senior advocate Salman Khurshid, representing Mr. Khan, argued that his client had been falsely implicated in the FIR and that there was nothing on record which showed that Mr. Khan was a part of a mob or present at the scene of crime (SOC).Justice Prasad said, “A perusal of the material on record has revealed to the court that the video footage wherein the petitioner [Mr. Khan] is seen does not indicate whether the petitioner was a part of the unlawful assembly at the SOC”.Even though Mr. Khan could be seen dislocating a CCTV camera and inciting the crowd, the court said whether he was a part of the conspiracy or not could be ascertained only after evidence was filed.The usage of a wiper to turn away the CCTV camera implied that Mr. Khan may have been in the knowhow of the impending riots, Justice Prasad observed. The extent to which the charge could be added against him could not be deconstructed by this court at this point and was a matter of trial, he added."
4	"The Delhi High Court has rejected the bail plea of a man facing prosecution in the murder case of 85-year-old Akbari Begum during the north-east Delhi riots.While dismissing the plea of the accused, Vishal Singh, the court noted that he was not a “mere curious onlooker” but a part of the mob which set fire to a house, resulting in Begum’s death on February 25, 2020. The court, however, granted bail to two other accused — Arun Kumar and Ravi Kumar — in the same case, saying they were not seen actively participating with the mob in the video footage of the incident.The case relates to an FIR registered on February 27, 2020, at the Bhajanpura police station by a man whose house was set on fire by a mob. According to the complainant, the crowd was chanting slogans of “Jai Shri Ram”. He complained that the mob broke open his house locks, entered the premises and set it on fire. He said his family members ran to the rooftop and were later rescued by the police with the support of local residents. ‘Too old to escape’ The complainant said his mother, Akbari, was too old to escape. After extinguishing the fire, the family found her body on a folding bed on the second floor. The investigation into the case was later transferred to Special Investigation Team-II, Crime Branch, Delhi.Justice Subromonium Prasad passed three separate judgments on the bail pleas of the three accused.In the case of Vishal Singh, the court said: “The petitioner (Vishal Singh) was not a mere curious onlooker and the mob, in which the petitioner was participating, set fire to the house of the complainant resulting in the death of an old lady.” “The clinching evidence that tilts this court to prolong the incarceration of the petitioner is his presence in the video clipping wherein he is clearly identified at the scene of crime, dragging a scooty and pelting stones towards the residence of the complainant,” the court said.In Arun Kumar’s case, the High Court remarked that “even though the petitioner was spotted with a lathi, he was not been seen attacking any person with the lathi”. “The atmosphere where incident took place was charged and considering that the petitioner (Arun) herein is the neighbour of the complainant, it cannot be said with certainty that the presence of the accused at that time with the lathi alone is sufficient to conclude that he was an active member of the unlawful assembly that set the house of the complainant on fire,” the court said.On Ravi Kumar, the High Court said the video footage only shows him muffling his face. “He is not seen actively participating with the mob. The petitioner (Ravi) only seems to be a curious onlooker,” the court said."
5	" The anti-CAA protest was secular but the charge sheet in the Delhi riots conspiracy case was communal and the police fabricated a story to suit its narrative, former JNU student leader Umar Khalid told a court in New Delhi on November 2 calling it a “naked form of false implication”.Senior advocate Trideep Pais, appearing for Mr. Khalid, made the remarks during a hearing on Mr. Khalid’s bail plea in a case related to the communal violence that had broken out in north-east Delhi on February 24, 2020, after clashes between the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) supporters and its protesters spiralled out of control.Mr. Khalid and several others have been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), a stringent anti-terror law, accused of being the “masterminds” of the riots which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured.Arguing his bail plea before Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat, Mr. Pais said the charge sheet was a fertile imagination of the police, calling the investigating officer (IO) a scriptwriter who “literally wrote a novel”.“No recovery, not present in Delhi, no violence attributed to me, no traces of funding,” Mr. Pais told the court while opposing Delhi Police’s allegations levelled against Mr. Khalid.The police had earlier said that Mr. Khalid’s bail plea had no merit and, referring to the charge sheet, asserted it would demonstrate the prima facie case against him before the court.During the hearing, Mr. Pais told the court, “Much after the riots happened, they registered the case, cooked up statements, or simply matched CDR location and if it matched with the co-accused, they arrested me.” Referring to the anti-CAA protest, he further said, “Not a single witness spoke that women were exploited, that there was a secular cover, etc. In fact, you will see a number of personalities who are educated, working in different fields, associated with CAA. Luckily they are not accused.”“In fact, the shoe is on the other side. The protest was secular, the charge sheet is communal,” he noted. Mr. Pais further said that if Delhi Police was a fair investigating agency, it would not have attributed ‘Tukde Tukde’ phrase from some other case’s charge sheet to the present one.“You have a political person who speaks against the state and you want to frame him. It is a naked form of false implication. You have fabricated a story to suit your narrative. This man is innocent. He has not done anything,” he added.On allegations that Mr. Khalid directed JNU student Sharjeel Imam and others to block the roads at Shaheen Bagh and Muslim-dominated areas, Mr. Pais submitted that while the prosecution claimed that chakka jam was equal to a terror act, it is not an offence and has been used by students, farmers, and others while participating in various agitations.On the police’s claims that women were paid money to sit at the protest site, he submitted, “Has any of the women come before you [police] to say that money was given to them. First of all, I take offence to this. Don’t they have their own say to sit there and protest?”In the last hearing, on October 12, Mr. Khalid, through his lawyer, said that the investigating officer wrote fanciful stories in the chargesheet and asked if organizing chakka jaam is an offence or does it invite the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).“Your [prosecution] wish to paint every accused with one brush as if it was one conspiracy crumbles when you look at the chargesheet. Where do you get it from? You got it from your mind. Half of it is a fertile imagination. None of this is supported by any statement,” Mr. Pais had said.Besides him, JNU students Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, Jamia Coordination Committee members Safoora Zargar, former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain and several others have been booked under the stringent anti-terror law in the case."
6	" Shahrukh Pathan, who had allegedly
pointed a gun at a Delhi Police head constable during the
2020 Delhi riots , on Thursday told a court here that he did not fire shots at the cop and merely wanted to scare him and not kill, a claim opposed by the prosecution.
A photograph of Mr. Pathan pointing a gun at Delhi Police Head Constable Deepak Dahiya had gone viral on social media during the communal riots last year. He was
arrested on March 3, 2020 , and is currently lodged in Tihar Jail.
To show that there was no attempt to murder the cop, Senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy, representing Mr. Pathan, played a 26-seconds long video of the incident in the court and said that the accused fired two shots - one in the air and second to his right, following which he had a heated conversation with Mr. Dahiya and turned back.Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat then asked the lawyer to replay the video and pointed towards the position of Mr. Pathan's gun just before he shot fire in the air.“Look at the position of his gun. It is not pointed up. It is straight [at Mr. Dahiya]. When he is taking the aim, it is straight,” the judge noted. The advocate, however, clarified that neither of the two gunshots was aimed at the head constable. ""The State's case is based on (Mr.) Dahiya. He is the potential victim and is not fired at. The first is in the air and the second is on the right,"" she said.Ms. Guruswamy added, “If I (accused) wanted to shoot him, I would have but that was not the intention. The accused turned around and ran away. Does any of this demonstrate the intention to kill or shoot him? At best, this is the intention to scare.” Mr. Pathan's counsel said that he did not shoot Mr. Dahiya but instead asked him to step back.“We had a conversation as heated as it can be and then we retreated. Where is the intention to kill?” she submitted.She further said, “I had ample opportunity in this 26 seconds to kill Dahiya or to say the least to injure him. I am trying to scare him. Objectionable as it is for a citizen to scare a police officer, Section 307 IPC [attempt to murder] is not made out because I had no intention to kill.” Special Public Prosecutor Anuj Handa, appearing for the police, said that the accused had clearly pointed the gun at the cop.Opposing Ms. Guruswamy's arguments that Mr. Pathan had no intention to kill the cop, Mr. Handa said, “The gun is pointed slightly downwards directly at the head of the complainant. His hand going upwards is because of the recoil after shots are fired.” “The question I ask myself is this, during the first part of the video, he shoots at the different directions of the mob, who might be belonging to the different community. Suppose any person would have succumbed to the injuries, would the offence not have been made out?” the prosecutor asked.Mr. Pathan is facing charges of offences such as rioting with a deadly weapon, an attempt to murder, assault, and obstructing public servants in the discharge of duty under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Arms Act. Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi in February 2020, after violence between the
Citizenship (Amendment) Act  supporters and its protesters spiraled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured.

7	" A Delhi court Wednesday dropped charges of arson against ten people accused of allegedly looting shops during the February 2020 riots, saying the police was trying to cover up a flaw and clubbing incidents of two different dates. The case was registered on the basis of three complaints – one Birjpal stated that his rented shop was looted by a riotous mob at Brijpuri Road on February 25, while Diwan Singh claimed that two of his shops were looted on February 24. Revoking arson charges, Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav noted the complainants did not state a single word regarding the riotous mob committing “mischief by fire or explosive substance” in their initial statements. Diwan Singh, in his supplementary statement, stated however that the riotous mob put his shop on fire, to which the court said that the investigating agency cannot “cover up the flaw” by recording the supplementary statements if the offence of arson was not there in initial complaints made to the police. The judge further said that arson charges cannot be invoked merely on the basis of statements of police witnesses who were posted as beat officers in the area on the date of the incident. ASJ Yadav said that he is unable to comprehend how an incident that took place on February 24 can be clubbed with the incident which occurred on February 25 unless and until there is clear evidence that the same rioters were operating on both dates.“In view of the aforesaid discussion, I am of the considered view that ingredients of Section 436 IPC [mischief by fire or explosive substance] are not at all made out from the material produced on record by the investigating agency,” the judge said. The ten accused are Mohd Shahnawaz, Mohd Shoaib, Shahrukh, Rashid, Azad, Ashraf Ali, Parvez, Mohd Faizal, Rashid, Mohd Tahir. The other sections invoked in the chargesheet such as Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with a deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 188 (disobedience to order by public servant), 354 (assault), 392 (robbery), 427 (mischief), 452 (house trespass), 153-A (promoting disharmony on grounds of religion), 506 (criminal intimidation) are “exclusively triable” by a Magistrate, ASJ Yadav said. He ordered for the case to be transferred to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate. Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi in February 2020, after violence between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and its protesters spiraled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured."
8	" A Delhi court has framed charges of rioting and attempt to murder against Shahrukh Pathan, who had allegedly
pointed a gun at a police officer during the 2020
Delhi riots , while rejecting his plea seeking discharge.
A photograph of Pathan pointing a gun at Delhi Police Head Constable Deepak Dahiya had surfaced on social media during the communal riots last year. He was arrested on March 3, 2020, and is currently lodged in Tihar Jail.Also read: Delhi violence | When the Centre cannot hold — on communal fault lines, state apathy and hope that lingers amidst despairWhile framing the charges, additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat said it was quite apparent that Pathan led a group of rioters, attempted on Dahiya’s life, obstructed and used criminal force on a public servant on February 24, 2020.The judge charged Pathan under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting armed with a deadly weapon), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of duty), and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC.Charges were also framed under Sections 353 (assault), 307 (attempt to murder) read with Section 149 (member of unlawful assembly guilty of a common offence) of the IPC and various Sections of the Arms Act, to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.Pathan had sought discharge from Sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC on grounds that he had no intention to kill the cop and was unaware that Section 144 of the CrPC was in force.Section 144 of the CrPC prohibits the assembly of four or more people in a specific area.Also read: Delhi violence | Looted, burnt out homes offer little welcome to Shiv Vihar’s riot victimsDenying the relief, ASJ Rawat noted that “intention to kill” the police personnel was clearly made out from the statement given by Dahiya that Pathan aimed at his head and fired but he managed to escape.The judge further said contentions made by Pathan’s counsel that he did not attempt to kill the cop but only threatened him by firing in the air cannot be a basis for discharge in the face of the specific statement by Dahiya and the video footage.“Secondly, even as per the video footage, the accused raised his pistol (not sideways but straight) aiming at the victim who is taller in height than him, but the direction of the pistol is certainly aimed at the head of Head Constable Deepak Dahiya, and even the point at which the trigger is pulled, the aim is straight towards Head Constable Deepak Dahiya,” the judge noted in an Order dated December 7. “Usually after firing or pulling of the trigger, there is a jerk, and the hands and the pistol is raised up because of the jerk. Thus, even the video shows firing by
accused Shahrukh Pathan from pistol in daylight with an aim to kill Head Constable Deepak Dahiya,” he added.
The judge also took exception to the argument by the counsel of the accused that after the first firing, Pathan had a second opportunity to kill Dahiya but did not as there was no intention.Judge Rawat said that the incident occurred in a flash of seconds, and to diminish the valour of a brave policeman by arguing it as an act of magnanimity of the accused in not killing the policeman is neither palatable nor legally sound.Denying discharge in Section 188 of the IPC, the judge said it was not an ordinary case of groups committing an unlawful act, but riots of such a nature as has not been witnessed since the anti-Sikh riots of 1984 and hence, knowledge of Section 144 of the CrPC can be presumed.Pathan had raised the contention that the promulgation order under Section 144 of the CrPC was not brought to his knowledge and hence, Section 188 of the IPC is not made out.The judge, however, said, “Once the promulgation order is in force, knowledge is presumed in the context of the situation that prevailed at that time. Thus, charge under Section 188 of the IPC is made out.” Judge Rawat further said that discrepancies in the statement of Dahiya in the charge sheet and certain interviews will be looked into at the stage of the trial.Besides Pathan, the judge also framed charges against four more accused, Kaleem Ahmad, Ishtiyak Malik, Shamim and Abdul Shehzad, in the case.Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi in February 2020 after violence between Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and its protesters spiralled out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured."
9	" The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the authority of
Delhi Assembly’s Peace and Harmony Committee to summon Facebook India’s senior official Ajit Mohan in connection with the February 2020 communal violence, saying the Capital can ill-afford another riot, and the
role of Facebook “must be looked into” in this context.
“It is difficult to accept the simplistic approach adopted by Facebook — that it is merely a platform posting third-party information and has no role in generating, controlling or modulating that information,” a three-judge Bench led by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul observed. Also read:
Facebook must take responsibility for content on its platform: SCThe 188-page judgment referred to how Facebook itself claims to be the most popular social media in India, with 270 million registered users. Social media platforms like Facebook have become “power centres” with the ability to influence vast sections of the public opinions, the court noted. These platforms are by no means altruistic in character. They employ business models that can be highly privacy intrusive. It compared Facebook to a “mass circulation media” with no or little editorial responsibility.“Facebook has acknowledged in their reply that they removed 22.5 million pieces of hate speech content in the second quarter of 2020 itself,” Justice Kaul, who authored the judgment, observed.Facebook cannot claim any “exceptional privilege” to abstain from appearing before the Peace Harmony Committee constituted by the Delhi Assembly. The court termed Mr. Mohan’s appeal in the apex court “premature”, saying no coercive action was taken or intended. The Committee merely wanted him to depose as a witness.The court lashed out at how the social media giant, by its own admission, appears only before committees which serve their commercial and operational interests. “But if their business interests are not served, they seek a right to stay away. Such a stand is completely unacceptable to us. Facebook has the power of not simply a hand but a fist, gloved as it may be,” Justice Kaul emphasised.Delhi riots | Legislative Assembly has no power to call Facebook official, Centre tells Supreme CourtThe court rejected Facebook’s argument that the Committee had no jurisdiction over law and order in Delhi, and it was encroaching into the Centre’s turf.“The concept of peace and harmony goes much beyond law and order and police… The unfortunate communal riots led to the death of 53 persons, caused significant damage… The complexity of communal tensions and their wide-ranging ramifications is a matter affecting citizens of Delhi. It cannot be said that the Government of Delhi cannot look into the causal factors in order to formulate appropriate remedial measures,” Justice Kaul reasoned.The judgment said an “informed deliberation” by the Assembly’s elected representatives on the best measures to combat online mass hate and violence in their geographical jurisdiction was very much within the Committee’s competence.However, the court said the Facebook representative appearing before the Committee need not answer any query from the Committee directly regarding law, order and the police.Right to silence a virtue in these “noisy times”: Facebook officialThe court dismissed Facebook’s argument that the Assembly ought to confine itself to making laws rather than enquire into the circumstances of the riots.“We cannot accept the plea that an Assembly must confine itself to the core function of legislation. This would be unreasonably restricting the role of an elected body… It is not only their concern but their duty to ensure that ‘peace and harmony’ prevails,” the court underscored.The court also declined a plea that the Committee had no power to summon “outsiders” or non-Members of the Assembly like Facebook.“Members and non-members can equally be directed to appear before the Committee and depose on oath,” Justice Kaul observed.

10	"Arshad Alam, Amaan Iqbal, Deepak Kumar, Mohammad Hamza and many others were killed in communal riots that convulsed north-east Delhi in late February 2020. Many more were injured, or victims of arson. The Home Minister stated on March 11 that “over 700 FIRs” had been filed. Yet about 80 days after the riots started, little is known to the public about the status of most cases as the police aggressively and selectively pursue a few FIRs and seek to project a so-called “conspiracy” behind the riots, led by anti-CAA protest organisers.Significantly, 38 out of 53 recorded killed in the riots were Muslims, as were majority of those otherwise affected. Most anti-CAA protest organisers being targeted by the police under the supposed “conspiracy” are also Muslims. This line of investigation is being followed with suspiciousspeed, under twin pressures – COVID-19 lockdown and under threat of the draconian UAPA, added to one of the FIRs (FIR 59/20 of 6.3.20) police are pursuing – both curbing the ability and right of those arbitrarily implicated to access legal help.This has deliberately diverted attention from well-reported facts – BJP leader Kapil Mishra’s role, the fact that no FIR still exists against him or other leaders, incidents of communal violence by mobs, including Hindu aggressors, and many instances of communal bias of the police, including illegal detentions of Muslims and refusal to lodge ‘missing person’ complaints by Muslims.This diversion is quite likely being abetted also by the problems and weaknesses in routine FIRs filed in riot-related cases (in a manner reminiscent of Gujarat in 2002). FIRs are crucial instruments through which police have control over what is regarded as truth. Discrepancies in recording of FIR can lead to improper investigation and acquittal of the guilty. About 40 FIRs (related to the north-east Delhi riots) accessed by a Delhi-based civil rights group, Peoples Union for Democratic Rights (PUDR) and in its possession, reveal crucial discrepancies.One, several Muslim victims have faced problems while trying to lodge FIRs. Two, in few where they have managed to, charges have been diluted and non-bailable sections against Hindu names have been visibly dropped. Three, there is evidence of a single FIR combining multiple incidents. Four, the police have chosen to be the complainant even in those instances where there were independent witnesses. Given the evidence in this small sample of FIRs, the communal bias of police in the north-east Delhi riots is evident in the manner in which the FIRs have been lodged by them.Through this bizarre, blatant rescripting of the narrative of the riots, the subversion of truth is being presided over by the state. This needs to be called out, and halted. It is imperative, for the sake of justice that all FIRs pertaining to the riots be opened to public scrutiny. Collection of evidence – CCTV footage, phone records, etc., and physical evidence and investigation also need to be made transparent and monitored.Arrests as intimidationOne obvious consequence of the rescripting of the riots is the criminalisation of anti-CAA demonstrations which had gone on peacefully at different sites for months, protests which werelegitimate, constitutional, and which raised very valid concerns. Further, the rescripting has diverted attention from the state’s failure to prosecute accused in the massive police attack on Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) students in December 2019, which also drew extensive international criticism. The JMI authorities, backed by the courts, sought registration of FIR into police action in January 2020. And yet, no FIR has been filed. Is it a coincidence that many of those arrested recently in the so-calledriots “conspiracy” are associated with JMI? Is it a coincidence that prominent persons, like the Chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission, who question selective arrests of Muslims, are being charged under sedition for a tweet? The intimidatory objective of such arrests and charges is absolutely clear.In the midst of this noise around the manufacture of a conspiracy, and the attempt to erase the truth of the riots, we must persevere in the ‘struggle of memory against forgetting’ and ensure that state institutions are held accountable to their constitutional and legal responsibility of treating all citizens equally, ensuring fair recording of riot crimes, systematic collection of evidence, fair investigation and prosecution of all guilty.Nothing more is needed. Nothing less will do.Radhika Chitkara and Vikas Kumar are secretaries of Peoples Union for Democratic Rights, a Delhi-based civil rights group."
11	"The Delhi Police Special Cell on Wednesday filed the third supplementary chargesheet in the north-east Delhi riots larger conspiracy case before a special court. The chargesheet, which includes several Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) reports and information on alleged meetings held among the “conspirators”, was filed before the court of Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat. During the hearing, Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad submitted that the chargesheet also contained reports pertaining to acid attacks on policemen and voice samples taken from one of the accused, former Jamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha.The court is yet to take cognisance of the latest supplementary chargesheet. The first chargesheet in the case was filed in September 2020, following which the first supplementary chargesheet was filed in October that year. The second supplementary chargesheet was submitted by the police early last year.While the first chargesheet named 15 accused, including student activists Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Asif Iqbal Tanha, the second chargesheet added three more persons as accused — former JNU students Umar Khalid, Sharjeel Imam and SIM card seller Faizan Khan.The second supplementary chargesheet pertained to information regarding CCTV cameras in locations that witnessed violence and how they were “incapacitated” and covered with cloth in order to hide evidence.The police have accused all the 18 persons named in the case of “hatching a conspiracy” and mobilising people through different secret meetings and WhatsApp conversations to carry out the riots."
12	"The Delhi High Court has granted bail to six persons accused in a murder committed during the 2020 north-east Delhi riots, noting that there cannot be an umbrella assumption of guilt on behalf of every accused when there is a crowd involved.Justice Subramonium Prasad granted bail to Mohd. Shoaib, Parvez, Mohd. Tahir, Rashid, Mohd. Faisal and Shahrukh, all arrested over 21 months ago in connection with the murder of a 20-year-old youth Dilbar Negi.According to the prosecution, the police received a call on February 26, 2020, that some rioters were throwing stones in Bhagirathi Vihar. When they reached the spot, they found that the house of the owner of a sweet shop, located in Main Brijpuri Road, had been set ablaze by the rioters. The police found a half-burnt body of Negi, a waiter at the sweet house.The public prosecutor opposed the bail on the ground that all the accused “actively participated” in the riots in which Negi was burnt alive.The public prosecutor submitted that it is of no consequence that no specific conduct can be attributed to the accused and that having participated in the riotous mob, the accused is responsible for not only his own actions, but also the actions of the others.In this case, the issue which arises for consideration before the court was that when an offence of murder is committed by an unlawful assembly, then whether each person involved should be denied the benefit of bail, regardless of his role or object of the crowd.Justice Prasad clarified, “When there is a crowd involved, at the juncture of grant or denial of bail, the court must hesitate before arriving at the conclusion that every member of the unlawful assembly inhabits a common intention to accomplish the unlawful common object.”“There cannot be an umbrella assumption of guilt on behalf of every accused by the court, and every decision must be taken based on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances in the matter therein,” Justice Prasad said.Against principlesThe HC also took note of the fact that all the accused persons have been in jail for over 21 months now. “It is egregious and against the principles enshrined in our Constitution to allow an accused to remain languishing behind the bars during the pendency of the trial,” the court said.“Bail is the rule and jail is the exception, and courts must exercise their jurisdiction to uphold the tenets of personal liberty, subject to rightful regulation of the same by validly enacted legislation,” it added.The court also said that the presence of the accused “at the scene of crime is inconclusive at this juncture and can only be confirmed during the course of trial and cannot justify the prolonged incarceration of the petitioner at this point of time”."
13	"A Delhi court on Thursday reserved its order on the bail plea of former JNU student Umar Khalid in a case of a larger conspiracy in connection with Delhi riots during February 2020.Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat said that the order on the bail plea of Mr. Khalid would be pronounced on March 14.Also read | Umar Khalid referred to web series to create a perception, court toldDuring the argument, the accused told the court that the prosecution lacked the evidence to prove its case against him.Mr. Khalid, along with several others, has been booked under the anti-terror law — Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) — in the case for being the ""masterminds"" of the February 2020 riots, which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured.The violence had erupted during the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).Besides Mr. Khalid, activist Khalid Saifi, JNU students Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, Jamia Coordination Committee members Safoora Zargar, former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain and several others have also been booked under the stringent law in the case.

14	"A Delhi court on Thursday dismissed former JNU student leader Umar Khalid bail plea in connection with the Northeast Delhi riots UAPA larger conspiracy case.The order was passed by Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat after he deferred the order on Mr. Khalid’s bail plea thrice previously due to late submission of written arguments from both defense counsel and the prosecutor.The court had reserved order in the case earlier this month. Senior Advocate Trideep Pais was arguing on behalf of Mr. Khalid while Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad was arguing against the bail.During the course of arguments, which stretched for around eight months, Mr. Pais submitted that the Delhi Police Special Cell’s case was fabricated and were based on doctored clips of Mr. Khalid’s Amravati speech run by television news channels. Mr. Pais also argued that the entire charge sheet naming Mr. Khalid as the mastermind of the conspiracy read like the script of popular television series Family Man and were nothing but hyperbolic allegations.Meanwhile, the prosecutor argued that Mr. Khalid wanted to create a perception by comparing his case to Family Man and Trial of Chicago 7 and didn’t have anything to argue on the merits of the case.SPP Prasad further submitted that Mr. Khalid was part of several secret meetings where chakka jams which led up to the riots were carefully planned and conceptualized.Mr. Khalid is among the 18 accused in the UAPA case, which includes other student activists such as Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal. "
15	"The Delhi High Court on Tuesday reissued fresh notices to several political leaders, based on pleas to make them parties to the proceedings seeking investigation against them for allegedly delivering hate speeches leading to the February 2020 riots.Among those who were issued fresh notices by the court, are BJP leader and Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting Anurag Thakur, Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, and senior AAP leader and Delhi’s Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia.A Bench of Justice Siddharth Mridul and Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar issued fresh notices as the earlier notices issued by the High Court on February 28 this year could not be served due to the non-payment of process fees by the petitioners.“Notices could not be served to the proposed respondents (politicians, activists and others) as process fees were not filed. On the filing of process fees by the petitioners within two days and taking all other steps, let fresh notices be issued to all the proposed respondents,” the High Court said while posting the case for hearing on April 29.NGO ‘Lawyers Voice’, in its plea, has sought registration of FIRs for hate speech against Aam Aadmi Party MLA Amanatullah Khan, AIMIM leader Akbaruddin Owaisi, former AIMIM MLA Warris Pathan, activist Harsh Mander, actor Swara Bhasker, and BG Kolse Patil — former Bombay High Court Judge and others.Lawyers Voice has stated in its application that public discourse cannot become a tool to promote speech that is inimical to public order and if FIR is not registered, the wrongdoers will be encouraged.One Shaikh Mujtaba Farooq also filed an application seeking FIR for hate speech against BJP leaders Anurag Thakur, Kapil Mishra, Parvesh Verma and Abhay Verma. In his plea, Mr. Farooq has stated that after the political leaders “engaged in the hate speech and exhortation to murder peaceful protestors, attacks broke out all across Delhi”.Earlier in July 2020, the Delhi police had informed the High Court that during their investigation in cases related to North-East Delhi riots, the police had found “no actionable evidence has surfaced yet” against political leaders “in instigating and or participating in the riots”.“As such, as and when substantial and cogent evidence of involvement of the aforesaid persons in the commissioning of any offence surfaces, the Delhi police will take suitable steps in the already registered FIRs. However, no fresh FIR is warranted at this stage,” the Delhi police had said in its affidavit."
16	"The High Court, while granting bail to Devangana Kalita, Natasha Narwal and Asif Iqbal Tanha on Tuesday, gave the Delhi Police a dressing-down for “casually” invoking provisions of anti-terror laws against the three students who had protested against the enactment of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).Jawaharlal Nehru University students Ms. Kalita and Ms. Narwal, along with Jamia Millia Islamia Mr. Tanha, were arrested in connection with the northeast Delhi riots last year.“We are constrained to say, that it appears, that in its anxiety to suppress dissent and in the morbid fear that matters may get out of hand, the State has blurred the line between the constitutionally guaranteed ‘right to protest’ and ‘terrorist activity’,” a Bench of Justice Siddharth Mridul and Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani said.“If such blurring gains traction, democracy would be in peril,” it said.The High Court ruled that no offence under the anti-terror law — Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) — is made out against any of the three students.“The phrase ‘terrorist act’ cannot be permitted to be applied in a cavalier manner to criminal acts or omissions that fall squarely within the definition of conventional offences as defined inter alia under the IPC [Indian Penal Code],” the court said.“Having given our anxious consideration to this aspect of ‘likelihood’ of threat and terror, we are of the view that the foundations of our nation stand on surer footing than to be likely shaken by a protest, however vicious, organised by a tribe of college students or other persons, operating as a coordination committee from the confines of a University situated in the heart of Delhi,” the High Court observed.‘Right to protest sacrosanct’Noting that protests against governmental and parliamentary actions were legitimate, the Bench said though such protests were expected to be peaceful and non-violent, it was not uncommon for protesters to push the limits permissible in law.Citing the case of Ms. Kalita, the High Court observed, “Even if we assume for the sake of argument, without expressing any view thereon, that in the present case inflammatory speeches, ‘chakka jams’, instigation of women protesters and other actions, to which the appellant (Ms. Kalita) is alleged to have been party, crossed the line of peaceful protests permissible under our Constitutional guarantee, that however would yet not amount to commission of a ‘terrorist act’ or a ‘conspiracy’ or an ‘act preparatory’ to the commission of a terrorist act as understood under the UAPA”.Devangana Kalita’s caseMs. Kalita has been named in four FIRs filed in connection with the northeast Delhi riots. She was arrested on May 23 last year. She has already got bail in three of the FIRs. However, a trial court here had denied her bail in connection with the FIR where the UAPA was invoked against her.The prosecution case against her is that she, as part of a women’s rights group called Pinjra Tod, and other groups called the Delhi Protests Support Group, the Jamia Coordination Committee, Warriors, and ‘Auraton ka Inquilab’ participated in a ‘larger conspiracy’ which led to violence and rioting.The court, however, remarked that, “There is absolutely nothing in the subject charge-sheet, by way of any specific or particularised allegation, that would show the possible commission of a ‘terrorist act’ within the meaning of Section 15 of the UAPA”.“Surely the right to protest is not outlawed and cannot be termed as a ‘terrorist act’ within the meaning of the UAPA, unless, of course, the ingredients of the offences under Sections 15, 17 and/or 18 of the UAPA are clearly discernible from the factual allegations contained in chargesheet,” it added.Natasha Narwal’s caseMs. Narwal has three separate FIRs lodged against her arising from her alleged involvement with the protests against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens ((NRC). She, too, was arrested on May 23 last year.The case cited by the prosecution against her is that she was involved in instigating the local population in certain Muslim-dominated areas in Delhi, particularly women, to protest against the CAA and the exercise undertaken by the Central government for creating an NRC, by allegedly seeking to incite feelings of persecution.The High Court remarked that “allegations relating to inflammatory speeches, organising of ‘chakka jam’, instigating women to protest and to stockpile various articles and other similar allegations, in our view, at worst, are evidence that the appellant participated in organising protests”.“But we can discern no specific or particularised allegation, much less any material to beat out the allegation, that the appellant [Ms. Narwal] incited violence, what to talk of committing a terrorist act or a conspiracy or act preparatory to the commission of a terrorist act as understood in the UAPA,” it said.Asif Iqbal Tanha’s caseMr. Tanha was first arrested on May 19 last year in connection with the UAPA case. At the time of his arrest, he was already in judicial custody in another case registered in connection with the anti-CAA protest in December 2019.While he has already been granted bail in the earlier case, he was denied bail in the UAPA case by a trial court here on October 26, 2020.According to the prosecution, Mr. Tanha is one of the ‘masterminds’ and one of the main conspirators as well as instigators behind the riots that happened in northeast Delhi last year.The prosecution repeatedly urged that what was contemplated and, in fact, brought to fruition was not a “typical protest” but an “aggravated protest” which was intended to disrupt the life of the community in Delhi.“We find ourselves unpersuaded and unconvinced with this submission, since we find it is not founded on any specific factual allegation and we are of the view that the mere use of alarming and hyperbolic verbiage in the subject chargesheet will not convince us otherwise,” the Bench said pointing to “complete lack of any specific, particularised, factual allegations” that would make-out the ingredients of the offences under UAPA.“In fact, upon a closer scrutiny of the submissions made on behalf of the State, we find that the submissions are based upon inferences drawn by the prosecuting agency and not upon factual allegations,” the High Court highlighted."

18	"Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav, who was presiding over several cases related to the north-east Delhi riots at the Karkardooma court, was on Wednesday transferred to the Rouse Avenue court where he will serve as a Special Judge for cases pertaining to the Prevention of Corruption Act.ASJ Yadav has been replaced by Virender Bhatt, who earlier served as Special Judge at Rouse Avenue court.The transfer order issued by the Delhi High Court included seven Metropolitan Magistrates and four Additional Sessions Judges. In addition to ASJ Yadav, Metropolitan Magistrate Fahad Uddin, who presided over another of the four special courts hearing matters related to the February 2020 riots, has been transferred as Metropolitan Magistrate, Tis Hazari court. Shama Gupta will replace him.While hearing the riots cases, ASJ Yadav had passed several scathing orders and pointed out loopholes in investigations. During one such hearing last month, he had observed that “failure to conduct a proper investigation will torment sentinels of democracy”.‘Sorry state of affairs’A day before his transfer, ASJ Yadav had come down heavily on Delhi Police, saying one of its witnesses was “lying on oath” and it was “a very sorry state of affairs”. He had asked DCP (Northeast) for a report in the matter.He made the observation after Head Constable Sanoj stated on oath in his evidence that he had identified three rioters by their names and professions, namely Vikas Kashyap, Golu Kashyap and Rinku Subziwala. However, Assistant Sub-Inspector Ram Dass stated in his evidence that the three accused “could not be identified during investigation”. ASJ Yadav in his order said it appeared prima facie that one of the police witnesses in the case was lying on oath and the same was punishable under IPC Section 193 (punishment for false evidence).The court noted that while the Head Constable had categorically asserted about the accused’s presence at the spot, it was however admitted by the Investigating Officer (IO) “that there is nothing on record to substantiate that matter” and the fact that the three men were ever investigated despite their names being there on record.“On the contrary, it is stated that the identity of these accused persons could not be established during investigation,” the order read. ASJ Yadav further said there was no material available on record which showed that efforts were made by the IO to apprehend the three men. The case pertains to incidents of robbery and vandalism at multiple houses during the riots in the Johripur Pulia area."
19	"Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday handed over an appointment letter for a government job to late Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma’s brother Ankur Sharma.Mr. Ankit Sharma was killed during the 2020 north-east Delhi riots. His body was found in a drain near his home in the riot-hit Chand Bagh area in February 2020.Mr. Kejriwal said while the loss of Mr. Ankit Sharma’s life could not be made up for, he hoped that this government job and financial aid of ?1 crore would provide strength and support to the family. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the Education portfolio, said Mr. Ankur Sharma was being appointed in the Education Department as a ‘Junior Assistant.’ Mr. Sisodia urged Mr. Ankur Sharma to accept the offer and wished him luck on the occasion.“We can never compensate for the loss of a loved one’s life but I hope this government job and an assistance of ?1 crore brings the family strength. We will continue to stand by them and support them whenever needed” the Chief Minister tweeted.Meanwhile, calling out the government’s aid, Delhi BJP Spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said it was “regrettable” that on one hand Mr. Kejriwal and AAP leader Durgesh Pathak were “doing politics” over the compensation package extended to Mr. Sharma’s family, while on the other were giving “political patronage to his murderer” Tahir Hussain, a suspended AAP councillor.After receiving the job certificate from the CM, Mr. Ankur Sharma said, “My brother Ankit Sharma died during the Delhi riots. Since then, the Delhi government has supported me and my family at every step.” "
20	"The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has informed the Supreme Court that Indian Police Service officer Rakesh Asthana was granted extension of service and appointed Delhi Police Commissioner as a “special case of public interest” taking into consideration riots, crimes and “certain untoward and extremely challenging public order problems” with “international implications” witnessed in the Capital.“Rakesh Asthana, IPS, has been granted extension of service and has been appointed the Commissioner of Police, Delhi, initially for a period of one year beyond the date of superannuation on July 31, 2021 or until further orders, whichever is earlier, in relaxation of 16(1) of the AIS (DCRB) Rules, 1958 as a special case in public interest,” the Ministry said in an affidavit.The government dismissed the petition filed by Centre for Public Interest Litigation (CPIL), represented by advocate Prashant Bhushan, challenging the appointment as an “abuse of process of law and manifestly an outcome of some personal vendetta against the incumbent Police Commissioner”.Mr. Asthana, who is also a respondent in the case, in a separate affidavit, said the petitions were filed in the court following a scathing social media campaign to malign his reputation. He echoed the government’s version that the petitioner harboured a personal vendetta against him. He maintained that the petitioner was indulging in “selective criticism”. The law and order situation in Delhi was complex, he noted.On Wednesday, a Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud adjourned the case to January 11.‘Personal vendetta’The MHA has argued that eight Delhi Police Commissioners had been appointed by the same procedure without any complaints from the petitioner. It accused the petitioner of harbouring a personal vendetta against Mr. Asthana, who was shifted from the Gujarat cadre.“Delhi being the capital of the country has a specific and special requirement which witnessed certain untoward and extremely challenging public order problems/riots/crimes which have an international implication. This necessitated appointment of an experienced officer having diverse, multifarious experience of heading a police force in any large State/Central Investigating Agency/Para-military Security Forces, etc, to head the Delhi Police force,” its affidavit reasoned.The competent authority felt it necessary to have an experienced police officer like Mr. Asthana to head the Delhi force to “effectively negotiate and handle the peculiar policing needs, the law and order situation in the National Capital of GNCT of Delhi”, the MHA said.‘No irregularity’The Ministry denied any procedural irregularity/non-compliance of the applicable policy for effectuating inter-cadre deputation of Mr. Asthana from Gujarat to Arunachal Pradesh-Goa-Mizoram and Union Territory (AGMUT) cadre.“No fault can be found in appointment of Mr. Asthana as Commissioner of Delhi Police, as alleged or otherwise, by the petitioner. It is submitted that his inter-cadre deputation and the relaxation under Rule 16 of AIS (DCRB) Rules, 1958 stems out from its need in public interest which are more elaborately recorded in the original file pertaining to his appointment,” it submitted.A bare perusal of the file shows that the “best attempt” was made to find a suitable IPS officer to head the Delhi Police. A thorough search was made by the competent authority from the options available in the AGMUT cadre.“Since AGMUT cadre being a cadre comprising Union Territory and small northeastern States, it was felt that requisite experience of working and supervising the central investigating agency/paramilitary force and police force of a large State having diverse political and law and order problem was lacking in the present pool of available officers and hence in public interest, a decision was made by the Central government to have an officer who had experience in all the above fields to supervise Delhi Police force and to provide effective policing on the recent law and order situation which arose in the National Capital Territory of Delhi,” the affidavit explained.Relaxation of rulesThe Ministry reasoned that in case of hardship faced by the Central government/Cadre Controlling Authority (CCA) in finding a suitable officer for a specific post with special requirements within a cadre, it can relax the rules and grant extension of service to an officer in exercise of powers conferred to it under Rule 3 of the Residuary Rules and Section 21 of the General Clauses Act.Besides, the Ministry contended, the court’s 2006 judgment in Prakash Singh’s case was restricted to appointments of DGPs in States and did not extend to the Union Territories."
21	" Ties between India and Indonesia have been strained further over a series of  growing protests in Jakarta. The Indonesian government has reached out to New Delhi again to “convey concerns” over the violence in
Delhi and riots that left 53 people dead, while India has demanded security assurances for the Indian embassy in Jakarta and the Indian consulate in Medan.
The message that the Widodo government in Jakarta has delivered is two fold: that it is committed to assuring safety and security for the Indian Embassy in Jakarta and the Indian consulate in Medan, while at the same time asking India to engage with the negative public perception in Indonesia.“[Our] civil society and many organisations had a message and those messages were conveyed [to the government of India]. People have concerns, but the Indonesian govt. is confident that we are both pluralistic, democratic countries,” sources said, referring to the fact that Indonesia that has an 80% Muslim majority is also home to Buddhists and Hindus, and is not an Islamic state.The source also added that Indonesia would not “interfere” in India’s internal issues, but that the Indonesian public’s reaction to events in India was becoming an issue for their government as well.On March 1, the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had called in Indian Ambassador Pradeep Kumar Rawat to discuss the concerns, while Indonesian Ambassador to India Sidhartho Suryodipuro has held more than one meeting with the Ministry of External Affairs to raise the issues and discuss security arrangements for the Indian missions. Mr. Rawat is also due to meet Indonesian Vice-President Maaruf Amin, an Islamic cleric, later this week. On March 13, Jakarta saw another big gathering of protesters belonging mainly to Islamist organisations and civil society NGOs who picketed the Indian mission to protest against the
Citizenship (Amendment) Act  and the violence in Delhi. The protests have been organised on every Friday for the three weeks, with an unprecedented 1,100 police personnel deployed to ensure the embassy’s safety.
 Of particular worry was a meeting of the “Indonesian Ulema Council” (MUI) on Thursday that called for a “fact-finding team” from the United Nations to be sent to India to look into the CAA,
riots and actions in
Jammu and Kashmir , condemning what it called “the actions of Hindu extremists….against Indian Muslims,” and even called on the Indonesian government to ""boycott Indian goods"".
 India has not reacted thus far to the events in Indonesia. Last year, the government had raised
strong objections  with the U.K. government after
protesters were allowed to picket the High Commission  in London.
 The government has
publicly criticised Malaysia  and Turkey for their comments on the CAA and
events in Jammu and Kashmir  as these are “internal matters”.
 Tensions between India and Indonesia are also brewing over reports in the Indian media that an Indonesian Islamic NGO Aksi Cepat Tanggap had ‘funded’ the
violence in Delhi  and was linked to Pakistan’s Lashkar-e-Toiba. The reports, in at least two national television channels and a national daily, appeared a day after Home Minister Amit Shah had referred to evidence of a “foreign hand” in funding the riots from February 24-26 in northeast Delhi that has left thousands homeless.
In a statement released ahead of the protests on Friday, ACT supervisory council member Syuhelmaidi Syukur denied the allegations saying the organisation had only funded “humanitarian aid” to “victims whose houses have been damaged, widows who lost their children and people who lost their source of income due to the riots”."
22	"A Delhi court pulled up the police for the “sorry state of affairs” after it noted that no prosecutors were present during the hearing in a Delhi riots case on Wednesday and said that such instances led to cases being adjourned without any proceedings.Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Virender Bhatt made the remarks while hearing the murder case of a person named Alok Tiwari, registered at Karawal Nagar police station, in which six persons were accused. The case was at the stage of prosecution evidence.During the hearing, the court was informed by the naib court that he had called up Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad, who stated that he was busy in some matter in the Delhi High Court. Thereafter, he called up another prosecutor but he too expressed his inability to appear in the case, following which another Special Public Prosecutor Madhukar Pandey was contacted. He too did not respond positively.In response to this, the court noted: “This is the state of affairs with regard to these riot cases which are very sensitive in nature and for which this special court was set up. These cases were assigned to a panel of Special Public Prosecutors formed by the police so as to ensure proper and effective prosecution of these cases.”Prolonged incarceration ASJ Bhatt said that it has been noticed that in several cases, the SPPs to whom the cases are assigned do not appear in the court on account of which the cases have to be adjourned without conducting any proceedings. It results in delay of their disposal.The defence counsels also objected to the conduct of the prosecutors. They stated that the matters are being adjourned unnecessarily because of the absence of SPPs “due to which the incarceration of the accused gets prolonged for no fault of theirs’.The court noted that earlier also, it had communicated this to DCP (North-East) Sanjay Kumar Sain, with instructions to take corrective measures. The court directed the copy of the order to be sent to the DCP and asked him to look into the aspect seriously and appoint more SPPs to represent the State in Delhi riots cases.In September, a Delhi court had pulled up the police for its lackadaisical approach in dealing with the Delhi riots cases and directed the Delhi Commissioner of Police to look into the matter."
23	" Jamia Millia Islamia Alumni Association President Shifa-Ur-Rehman, who was arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in connection with the Delhi riots asked in the court on Tuesday why no FIR was registered against Union Minister Anurag Thakur, BJP leader Kapil Mishra, and others for allegedly instigating riots. During the bail hearing, Mr. Shifa's lawyer, Abhishek Singh, showed Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat a complaint filed by him on January 30, 2020, seeking registration of FIR against Mr. Thakur, Mr. Mishra, another BJP leader Parvesh Sharma, and Jamia Shooter Ram Bhakt Gopal for allegedly “instigating riots”.“Did the prosecution even bother to call them as witnesses or accused or issue a notice that we want to know something? Because they said 'shoot xyz' so they know who those people are. They will at least have some evidence. Why was no FIR registered against them? This was the complaint I was pursuing,” Mr. Singh said. According to the complaint, as read by the lawyer in the court, Mr. Shifa mentioned that Mishra took out a rally in which slogans to shoot were raised, following which Mr. Thakur on January 28, 2020, said: “desh ke gaddaron ko...” In January 2020, Thakur had allegedly egged on participants of an election rally to raise an incendiary slogan. While the minister raised the slogan ""Desh ke gaddaron ko... (the traitors of the country)"", the crowd responded by chanting: ""Goli maaro saalon ko... (shoot them)."" Mr. Shifa is accused of collecting money to fund various sit-in protests against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). He, along with several others, has been booked under the anti-terror law in the case for being the ""masterminds"" of the February 2020 violence, which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured. Alluding to the alleged funding, the lawyer affirmed that Mr. Shifa had made ""some financial arrangements"" but questioned whether paying some protestors make it an offence under the stringent UAPA. Advocate Singh further emphasized that being a member or president of the alumni association or a protester is not an offence as people are entitled to their opinion and can peacefully protest against anything.“Why have I been roped in? I fail to understand. There is a fundamental right to protest. If a certain section of society is aggrieved by certain legislation and protest against it, that is not a crime. They can protest,” the lawyer told the court. Furthermore, Mr, Shifa's counsel sought bail for him saying that there has been a systematic violation of his fundamental rights and that he cannot be put in the bracket of rioters. He also read his WhatsApp chats to show that there was no instigation of violence. Besides him, former JNU student leader Umar Khalid, JNU students Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, Jamia Coordination Committee members Safoora Zargar, former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain and several others have also been booked under the stringent law in the case."

Their bodies were recovered over a period of several days from the Bhagirathi Vihar drain.The police arrested Lokesh Solanki, Pankaj Sharma, Ankit Chaudhary, Sumit Chaudhary, Prince, Jatin Sharma, Himanshu Thakur, Vivek Panchal and Rishabh Chaudhary, after confirming their involvement in connection with the nine murders. All of them are in judicial custody.WhatsApp groupThey were part of a WhatsApp group “Kattar Hindut Ekta” that was created on February 25 to take “revenge” on Muslims. The creator of the WhatsApp group is still absconding.One of the accused, Lokesh Solanki, on February 25, messaged in the “Kattar Hindut Ekta” group: “Brother Lokesh Solanki this side from Ganga Vihar area if any Hindu need any back up then do contact. We have men, arms and ammunitions. I have just killed two Muslims in Bhagirathi Vihar area and thrown them in drain with the help of my team.”“Their [attackers] modus operandi was, they used to catch the people passing through the area and ascertain their religion by asking name, address and by their document i.e. Identity Card and they were forcing them to call ‘Jai Shri Ram’ many times. The person who was not calling ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and carrying the identity of Muslim identity, they were bluntly attacked and thrown into the Main Ganda Nala [dirty drain], Bhagirathi Vihar, Delhi,” the charge sheet said.A Police Control Room (PCR) call on February 25 at Gokalpuri Police Station and the caller mentioned: “Here Muslims are being killed and their vehicles are being burned.” The caller, who was a Hindu, and an eyewitness in the case, was traced during the investigation. The eyewitness himself was accosted by rioters on February 24 and found that his motorcycle was missing after he managed to free himself.On February 25, he went to the Gokalpuri Police Station to register a complaint that his bike had been stolen. At about 4 p.m., while returning home from the police station, he saw a large mob carrying stones, cudgels, sticks, swords and iron rods on the Johripur pulia (bridge) shouting slogans like “Jai Sri Ram” and “Har Har Mahadev”.Muslims targetedThey were checking the identity of persons passing through and if any Muslim was found, they were beating and throwing bodies in the drain after killing them, the charge sheet said. Most of the people in the mob were wearing helmets or had their faces muffled. He identified several rioters who were the part of the mob, the charge sheet said.Another eyewitness, in his statement to the police, said that he was part of a crowd of Hindu youth chanting “Jai Shri Ram” that brought out one person belonging to the Muslim community from his house and beat him with sticks and stones. When he died, they dumped his body in the drain.A Muslim man, who lost his shop and three vehicles in the riots, told the police that about 200-250 people had assembled near the Johripur drain and were raising slogans like “Jai Shri Ram”, “Hindu Ekta Zindabad”, “Jaago Hindu Jaago” in favour of the CAA through loudspeakers. Since many of them were locals, he knew them by name. All of them were carrying iron rods, sticks, lathis and dandas, and were insisting that Hindus assemble and kick out Muslim people from Bhagirathi Vihar, Delhi. They torched his shop located on ground floor of his house. He somehow managed to save his family, he had said.Chat transcriptsWhatsApp chat transcripts are also part of charge sheet where rioters were talking about how many Muslims they had killed, offers for reinforcements were made, and requests for arms and ammunitions were also placed on the chat group.The WhatsApp chat transcripts between the “Kattar Hindut Ekta” group members clearly fell in the category of extra-judicial confessions and had been done voluntarily, the charge sheet added.During the investigation, some more co-accused/suspects — Monty Nagar, Avdesh Mishra @ Sardar, Monu, Sahil @ Babu, Shekhar, Mongli, Baba and Tinku — were identified but are yet to be arrested since their addresses could not be ascertained. After their arrests, a supplementary charge sheet will be filed."

26	"A Delhi court on Wednesday granted bail to seven accused persons in a murder case related to the north-east Delhi riots, noting that they “cannot be incarcerated till the conclusion of trial, which will take a lot of time and particularly considering the [COVID-19] pandemic”.Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat while granting bail to the seven accused persons directed them not to leave the NCR without prior permission of the court. The court directed them not to tamper with any evidence or contact any witnesses. “They shall attend the court on every date of hearing or as directed by court,” it said, adding, “Immediately after their release, they shall intimate the local SHO concerned of their mobile number which they shall be using after their release”.The case related primarily to the murder of one Vinod Kumar near ICICI Bank, ATM Gali No.1, in Brahmpuri on February 24 last year. In all, 12 persons are accused in the case.The accused persons — Sagir Ahmad, Naved Khan, Javed Khan, Arshad alias Sonu, Gulzar, Mohd. Imran and Chand Babu — were taken in custody between March 30 and October 7 last year.The court noted that most of the accused have remained in custody for more than a year and other co-accused have already been granted bail. In the present case, the chargesheet has been filed and the investigation in relation to the accused persons has been completed. “Considering the facts and circumstances, period of custody and on the issue of parity, the applications of all the seven accused persons are allowed,” the court said."
27	" The city police has told the Delhi High Court that a plea moved by JNU student and Pinjra Tod activist Devangana Kalita, accused in a case related to northeast Delhi riots, seeking copies of videos of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was not maintainable.The issue regarding maintainability of the plea was raised before Justice Suresh K. Kait by Additional Solicitor General S.V. Raju, appearing for the Delhi Police.“Let the respondent [police] file an affidavit on the maintainability aspect within a week, with advance copy furnished to the other side. Response thereto, if any, be filed within five days thereafter,” the Court said and listed the matter for further hearing on February 4.Ms. Kalita, in her plea filed through advocates Adit S. Pujari, Tusharika Mattoo and Kunal Negi, has sought copies of videos of protests against the CAA and other electronic data available with the police in the matter that were filed along with the charge sheet in the case.While Ms. Kalita is in judicial custody in the case under the stringent anti-terror law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, she has been granted bail in the case related to the riots in Jaffarabad area.Earlier, before the trial court, Ms. Kalita’s counsel had sought copies of a pen drive containing video clips between February 22, 2020 and February 26, 2020; DVD containing video clips of incident on February 25, 2020 and CD containing photographs and video clips of the accused; DVD containing video clips of protests of January 5, 2020 and DVD containing video clips under Jaffarabad metro station between February 22, 2020 and February 23, 2020.Communal violence had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 last year after clashes between the citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured."
28	" A day after the
visiting U.S. President left, the
Congress Working Committee (CWC) met in Delhi to not only discuss the
Delhi riots that have killed 20 but also decided to submit a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind against the Delhi Police’s inability to contain the riots.
 On Tuesday, the party’s chief spokesperson had appealed to both the Centre (Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah) and Delhi’s elected Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to immediately
restore peace in the city , parts of which have been torn apart by ugly communal clashes.

“Do not fail this country just because you belong to different political parties,” said the Congress’ communication chief Randeep Surjewala, who claimed to made the appeal “on behalf of the people of Delhi”.Learning from mistakes For a party that was handed a resounding defeat in the recent Delhi Assembly elections, with only three of its 70 candidates managing to retain their security deposits, it isn’t a case of the party trying to reach out to the people who didn’t vote for them. Rather, it could be case of learning from their past mistakes. In December 2012, when the gruesome Nirbhaya gang-rape incident took place, most
Congress ministers and leaders were not only found wanting but seemed almost insensitive to the massive protests that broke out. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was nowhere to be seen and the party’s former chief minister, the late Sheila Dikshit, was jeered when she went to Jantar Mantar to light a candle and express solidarity.

In fact, in the unforgiving world of social media, Mr. Kejriwal was reminded of his June 2013 tweet just as critics of Mr. Modi juxtaposed pictures of Delhi burning with those from Ahmedabad, where the PM was busy hosting President Trump and his entourage at the ‘Namaste Trump’ event. “Sheila Dikshit’s response after each rape — ‘what can I do? Delhi police not in my control’. Do we want such a helpless CM?” Mr. Kejriwal had tweeted on June 27, 2013. The city replied soon after and Mr. Kejriwal has since been
elected for a third term in a row. Now that he is in power, has he done anything to shake off this helplessness?
AAP’s leadership While it’s true that the Delhi CM does not control Delhi Police in a way that he can order them to take action but the Indian Institute of Technology graduate-turned-politician surely understands that a riot cannot be controlled only by firing bullets. Communal riots need a pro-active leadership reaching out to community leaders, forming peace committees of prominent citizens in a
mohalla (locality), appealing for peace by going out as far as possible to the affected areas.

Has his government done any of this? On Tuesday, Mr. Kejriwal had
convened a meeting of all MLAs , in which some of these points, such peace committees and peace marches, were mooted, and
directions were issued to District Magistrates and Sub-Divisional Magistrates of the affected districts in Delhi.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Kejriwal attended an all-party meeting with Union Home Minister and
Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal ; appealed for peace by sitting at Rajghat, Mahatma Gandhi’s memorial; met the injured in a government hospital in east Delhi; apart tweeting his satisfaction that U.S. First Lady Melania Trump had attended a happiness class in a Delhi government school.
‘Alarming’Describing the situation as alarming, Mr. Kejriwal on Wednesday once again tweeted that he would asking the Home Minister to call in the Army. But an elected Chief Minister and his Cabinet colleagues should have led from the front, beyond Twitter and social media.As Delhi continues to be tense and counts its losses, it is clear that both the Centre and the Delhi government will have to share responsibility for the grossly inadequate response from the authorities. While the Centre seemed too taken up with the visit of the U.S. President visit and ignored the fallout of statements made by Aam Aadmi Party-turned
Bharatiya Janata Party leader Kapil Mishra’s open
threats of communal disturbance , Mr. Kejriwal’s poor political response is a reminder of his June 2013 tweet on Delhi’s “helpless” Chief Minister.

29	"A school for north-east riot victims has been running near the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border since November last year.When the communal riots broke out in the Capital, scores of people were displaced from their homes and the children could not go back to schools. Also, due to the COVID-induced lockdown, many families could not afford their education any longer.How it beganWhen Aasif Mujtaba, a PhD scholar from IIT-Delhi, met Class IV student Arsh, he found out that his family’s juice shop had been burnt down during the riots.Aasif, who also founded and runs an NGO called Miles2Smile Foundation, visited his family and got to know that they plan to send the boy to a stitching unit.This is when he decided to start this school where children from Nursery to Class VIII are being taught. It is just a few minutes from Shiv Vihar where violence had broken out last February.“I thought, there would definitely be hundreds of kids with the same problem. I was determined to open a school for them. Finally, we established Sunrise Public School. Currently, we have around 180 such kids enrolled in it,” he said. Arsh also goes to this school now.Sunrise Public School — where three rooms are currently functional with an assembly area in the middle and a playground, which is yet to made — opened on November 15.They currently have about 200 students enrolled out of which 25 from Class V-VIII are attending school for two hours — 10 a.m.-12 p.m.Principal speaksSchool principal is a 25-year-old graduate from Jamia Millia Islamia, Kishwar Shahzad. She said she has been a witness to the December 15 violence that broke out in her college last year. “I still can’t forget the trauma I underwent. I can’t imagine what these [riot-affected] people have gone through. Many of them have lost one of their parents or relatives in the riots,” she said.One of the first experiences of Ms. Shahzad was meeting parents, who had come with photographs of their burnt houses. “I recall visiting Shiv Vihar. I had stepped on a burnt pile of books inside a house; it was heartbreaking,” she said.Many parents said there was a private school in the area where their children used to study. After the riots, the school did not give any concession to the children whose parents could not afford the fees and also ill-treated them. Next, the children stopped going to the school. Subjects taught At the Sunrise Public School, they are teaching English, Urdu, mathematics, Hindi and science but in the new session starting in April, they are planning to add social studies, physical education, Islamiyat, computer science, arts and GK as well.“We are following an improved education system. It’s subject-wise rather than class-wise. Students have to move to different classes for different subjects rather than teachers coming to their classes,” Ms. Shahzad said."
30	"The Delhi Assembly’s Minority Welfare Committee has directed the government officials concerned to pursue criminal action against BJP leaders for giving alleged provocative speeches before the riots in north-east Delhi earlier this year. According to a statement issued by the committee, its chairman Amanatullah Khan had directed that action be pursued against BJP MP Parvesh Verma and party leader Kapil Mishra. Mr. Khan, it said, had directed Principal Secretary (Home) B.S. Bhalla for prompt action in relation to Delhi Police’s alleged refusal to share copies of FIRs registered in riots cases. Mr. Bhalla, as per the statement, said that the opinion of the Law Department will be sought over refusal of police to provide copies of FIRs. The committee looked at cases of loss suffered by complainants whose shops and houses were looted and burnt, but they were either paid little or no compensation, added the statement. The committee also watched a video clip in which four men in police uniform entered a mosque, which was allegedly later set ablaze, and heard submissions from some riot victims whose grievous injuries were documented as “minor” by doctors and the compensation amount disbursed to them was less than the losses suffered.Compensation worth over ?24 crore has been paid, the statement said. Out of a total 3,300 cases of compensation, 657 were rejected by officials, following review by the Waqf Board, but 86 were again found suitable for reconsideration, the statement added."
31	"An environment for violence was created before the riots broke out in the Capital in February, a recent report released by Citizens and Lawyers Initiative has stated.The report, titled ‘Delhi Riots of February 2020: Causes, Fallout and Aftermath’, claims that the implementation of Citizenship Amendment Act and the protests that followed gave rise to hate speeches, “which stoked the flames of communal violence”.‘Kapil Mishra’s speech’ “This culminated in the communally charged Delhi election campaign, which was eventually won by the Aam Aadmi Party without challenging the vitriolic content of its main Opposition. This gave rise to well-publicised gun-wielding vigilantes. The environment was as charged as a powder keg that just needed a spark to erupt. Kapil Mishra’s provocative speech in Jaffrabad, and the incendiary Facebook Live posts by Ragini Tiwari aka Janki Behen, appear to have had that effect; bolstered by rumour and misinformation on social media,” the report stated.According to the report, “ambiguous” role of police, inaction, “selective” complicity with Hindu rioters, and other factors lead to the escalation. The report also stated that the violence had multiple aspects, including the strategic deployment of rampaging mobs, local vigilantism and social media playing a role in coordinating and mobilising attacks and spreading misinformation to incite.“The failure of the law and order situation arose as a result of reported incidents of police partaking in the violence, providing tacit support to Hindu mobs, and failing to take appropriate action to staunch the loss of lives, livelihoods, and properties,” the report read.Talking about the compensation offered by the government, the report stated that it was less than what was offered during the Muzaffarnagar riots and there were also gaps in what was promised and what was delivered.Mentioning “political parallelism” in the investigation, the report claimed that the police put forward the narrative of the ruling party and that they chose to base their ‘analysis’ of the event on selective aspects of the witness statements “that conform to their existing narrative”.The report recommended the formation of a multi-stakeholder accountability team to supervise the investigation, institute adequate rehabilitation package, publish an account of compensation promises and disbursed, conduct trust drives.Former Supreme Court judge B.N. Srikrishna, who presided over the Commission of Inquiry into 1992-93 Bombay riots, who has written the prologue of the report, said: “It is time that the State machinery and constitutional functionaries display greater seriousness in the investigation of the causes of such riots and take appropriate steps to prevent their recurrence”."
32	"Bloomsbury India on Saturday said that it will not publish an upcoming book on the February Delhi riots after there was outrage over a virtual pre-publication launch, which it said was being organised without its knowledge.The authors — advocate Monika Arora and Delhi University teachers Sonali Chitalkar and Prerna Malhotra — were however, undeterred, saying one publisher may have declined but there many others to publish the book.The publishing house faced massive backlash online on Friday after an advertisement of the book launch on Saturday with BJP leader Kapil Mishra as a guest of honour did the rounds on social media.There have been allegations that several leaders including Mr. Mishra made inflammatory speeches targeting anti-citizenship law protesters before the violence broke out in Northeast Delhi on February 23.Publisher’s statementBloomsbury India issued a statement saying it strongly supports freedom of speech but also has a deep sense of responsibility towards society.

 “Bloomsbury India had planned to release
 Delhi Riots 2020: The Untold Story in September, a book purportedly giving a factual report on the riots in Delhi in February 2020, based on investigations and interviews conducted by the authors.”
“However, in view of very recent events including a virtual pre-publication launch organised without our knowledge by the authors, with participation by parties of whom the publishers would not have approved, we have decided to withdraw publication of the book. Bloomsbury India strongly supports freedom of speech but also has a deep sense of responsibility towards society,” the statement said.Authors reactThe authors slammed “left liberals and intellectuals” for launching a social media campaign against the book, its writers and guests of the launch including senior BJP leader Bhupender Yadav, Mr. Mishra and Bollywood filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri.“The book very well reveals how the urban Naxals and jihadists are weakening the theory of Indianness that is based on democracy, the Constitution and elections in the country,” Mr. Yadav said.Reacting to Bloomsbury India’s decision to withdraw itself from publishing the book, Ms. Arora said, “If one publisher withdraws, ten will rise. The messiahs of freedom of speech are scared of this book. They mounted a frontal attack on its writers, publisher and guests of the launch even before the book was released and one could go through it.”Mr. Mishra asserted “no power in the world can stop this book from coming out and people want to read it” and the “contractors of freedom of speech are scared that the book will expose how training was given for the riots and the propaganda machinery was involved in it“.Mr. Yadav said those behind Shaheen Bagh protest against the citizenship law earlier this year did not raise the issues of rights of women but spread “poison” in the society.Ms. Arora said that the Delhi riots need to be probed by the NIA, claiming it was “pre-planned”. She said the book has been divided into eight chapters and five annexures, all based on ground research in the riot-affected areas. The chapters of the book were about urban-Naxalism and jihadist theory in India, CAA, Shaheen Bagh Model, among others, she said.Ms. Malhotra said that the book was opposed by the “so-called leftist thinkers and intellectuals” who earlier “spread lies” that the citizenship law was against the Muslims.“The Delhi riots were an outcome of the urban Naxal and Islamic fanatics and the book exposes it,” she said.Ms. Chitalkar said the book was a result of “thorough ground research.”“We talked to everyone, including Muslims. We were not biased. This books takes stand against urban Naxals and Islamic jihadists, it is not an anti-Muslim book,” she claimed.Communal violence broke out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after citizenship law supporters and protesters clashed with each other in the area, leaving 53 people dead and nearly 200 injured.ReactionsA number of people took to Twitter to react to Bloomsbury’s decision with many decrying it.“I have not read the book in question & have no idea if it is good or bad. However, this is obviously not a quality control problem but about censorship. I commit to never publish a book with @BloomsburyIndia,” tweeted author, economist and Principal Economic Advisor in the Ministry of Finance Sanjeev Sanyal.“Bloomsbury is doing a Facebook and feels that their giving platform for hate will pass in India. Oh well appeasement of Sanghi falsehoods will not work. Will it adopt similar standards to legitimise and glorify and racists and fascists in America and Europe?,” tweeted All India Student Association (AISA).Author Ashwin Sanghi said, “What utter hypocrisy @BloomsburyIndia ... why did you agree to publish it if you had problems with the book?” Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi said, “After facing massive outrage, publishing house #Bloomsbury India has decided to withdraw the book titled
Delhi Riots 2020 - The Untold Story , which was slated to be launched on 22 August by #BJP leader #KapilMishra. Sense prevails & so does spine.”
Novelist Nilanjana Roy tagged a news report on the Delhi riots and tweeted, “Hi, @BloomsburyIndia. Some reasons why you should never have published a book that pushes the rightwing’s rotten conspiracy theory about the Delhi riots: Safoora, Meeran, Ishrat, Khalid, Devangana, Natasha, scores of local residents who are jailed.”The authors also put out tweets saying how their book exposes several wrong theories about the Delhi riots."
33	"A Delhi court on Thursday granted bail to former JNU student Umar Khalid in connection with an FIR alleging “criminal conspiracy” in a north-east Delhi riots case.The court questioned the rationale behind the police making a case of conspiracy against Mr. Khalid based on the statement of a public witness who allegedly saw him and former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain walk into a building at Shaheen Bagh on January 8 last year.“If principal accused Tahir Hussain was moved or actuated by the applicant (Khalid) in meeting dated January 8, 2020, then the applicant should have been made co-accused in 10 other cases [in which Hussain in an accused] also which is not the case,” Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav said.Mr. Khalid was initially arrested on September 13, 2020 in another north-east Delhi riots case being probed by the Special Cell, where charges under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) have been invoked.He was formally arrested in the present FIR on October 1, 2020, after seven months of registration of the FIR. Mr. Khalid will continue to remain in jail as he is yet to get bail in the UAPA case.The present FIR was registered on the statement of a constable who was on duty on main Karawal Nagar Road near Chand Bagh Pulia on February 24, 2020. According to the FIR, arount 2 p.m., a large crowd gathered on the road and started pelting stones.The constable ran to a nearby parking lot to save himself but the mob broke open the shutter and thrashed all the persons present inside. They set the vehicles parked there on fire.The motorcycle of the constable was also burnt by the rioters. He somehow managed to save his life. After registration of the FIR, further investigation of the case was transferred to the Crime Branch.‘Political vendetta’ Mr. Khalid in his bail plea argued that he had been falsely implicated in the matter by the investigating agency on account of “political vendetta to muzzle dissent”. The 33-year-old argued that he was not present at the scene of crime.The Special Public Prosecutor, on the other hand, submitted that the case was “sensitive” in nature as it involved the riots that took place around the house of the main accused, Hussain. During investigation, it had emerged that there was a “deep-rooted conspiracy” which triggered communal riots in Delhi, the SSP said.The court pointed out that the statement of the primary witness in the case merely talked of some meeting between Mr. Khalid, co-accused Hussain and Khalid Saifi. The same does not disclose about the subject matter of such meeting, said the court. Judge Yadav further highlighted that the same person was also a witness in the UAPA case. When the statement of this witness was recorded on May 21, last year in the UAPA case, “he did not utter a single word against” Mr. Khalid. “...Now all of a sudden”, he in his statement recorded on September 27, 2020, “blew the trumpet of criminal conspiracy” against the applicant, the Judge noted. “This prima facie does not appeal to the senses.”Keeping in view that the investigation in the case is complete, chargesheet has already been filed and the trial is likely to take a long time, the court granted bail to Mr. Khalid.“The applicant (Khalid) cannot be made to incarcerate in jail for infinity merely on account of the fact that other persons who were part of the riotous mob have to be identified and arrested in the matter,” the court said.

34	"A day after publishing house Bloomsbury India withdrew a book on Delhi riots, the authors on Sunday said the decision was in breach of contract and that the publishers would “invite civil and criminal liability.” The authors said the book would be brought out by another publisher. Backlash on social mediaThe book, ‘Delhi Riots 2020: The Untold Story’ by advocate Monika Arora and Delhi University teachers Sonali Chitalkar and Prerna Malhotra, was set to be released next month. The authors organised a launch event in which BJP leader Kapil Mishra was the guest of honour, leading to backlash on social media. Mr. Mishra had given a speech a day before the riots broke out in northeast Delhi in February, asking for the anti-Citizen (Amendment) Act, 2019 protesters to be removed from the area. The authors write about what they call “the urban Naxal and jihadi riot model.” “Bloomsbury India had planned to release ‘Delhi Riots 2020: The Untold Story’ in September, a book purportedly giving a factual report on the riots in Delhi in February 2020, based on investigations and interviews conducted by the authors.

Bloomsbury India strongly supports freedom of speech but also has a deep sense of responsibility towards society,” the publishing house said in a statement on Saturday.In a letter to Bloomsbury on Sunday, a copy of which Ms. Arora posted on Twitter, the authors said they had not been given a reason for the publisher’s decision to withdraw. They said they only received a phone call shortly before the online launch of the book on Saturday informing them that Bloomsbury U.K. had told the India office to distance itself from the book due to pressure from “social media campaign.” They said the draft of the book had been finalised by the publisher.They termed it a “breach of contract, unethical and unprofessional conduct” and said the publisher would be “liable to pay damages to the authors for damaging their reputation, disowning them publicly, causing mental agony ...”Later on Sunday evening, Ms. Arora said in a tweet that Bloomsbury had not responded in writing to the authors. “We have no option but to go with another publisher,” she wrote.In another tweet, she said: “As per peoples sentiments, we are going ahead with @GarudaPrakashan LET THE TRUTH BE REVEALED #DelhiRiotsTheUntoldStory (sic).”"
35	"The Delhi High Court on Monday granted three weeks interim bail to former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Natasha Narwal, arrested in connection with the north-east Delhi riots, to perform the last rites of her father who died of COVID-19 on Sunday.The court took note of the fact that deceased Mahavir Narwal was survived by a son, who himself is in self-isolation due to the pandemic, and that Ms. Natasha was the only family member who could conduct the cremation and last rites.Also ReadJailed Pinjra Tod activist Natasha Narwal’s father dies of COVID-19

It also noted the concern raised by the police that she should not comment or tweet on the pending trial while on interim bail.At the time of surrender, Ms. Natasha will have to furnish to the jail authorities a copy of her RT-PCR test report.Ms. Natasha, booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, was arrested on May 23 last year along with fellow JNU student Devangana Kalita in relation with an FIR registered on February 24 over the sit-in protest at Jafrabad Metro Station against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.Also ReadDelhi riots | Delhi High Court reserves order on bail pleas of JNU students in UAPA case

36	" A Delhi court on Thursday denied bail to former Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Tahir Hussain in three different FIRs related to the
northeast Delhi riots , noting that he used his muscle power and political clout to act as a kingpin in planning, instigating and fanning the flames of communal conflagration.
Additional Sessions Judge Vinod Yadav said that the public witnesses against Mr. Hussain were residents of the same locality and if released on bail at this stage, the possibility of him threatening or intimidating them could not be ruled out.The court also rejected Mr. Hussain’s contention that he be treated at parity with other co-accused persons in the cases who had been enlarged on bail. It said that the role assigned to Mr. Hussain in the cases was totally different and distinct from the rest of the co-accused, as he was the “main kingpin/conspirator in the case”.The judge noted that at the time of the eruption of the communal riots, Mr. Hussain had been in a powerful position (sitting AAP Councillor of the area).‘No cogent evidence’Mr. Hussain, who had been in judicial custody since March 16, argued that there was no cogent and legal evidence which was admissible in the eyes of law to connect him with the incident alleged in the cases.“There is no evidence by way of even a single video footage or CCTV footage to prove that the applicant (Hussain) had participated in the riots or caused damage to any property,” he argued.‘Victim of circumstances’Mr. Hussain said he belonged to ‘Aam Aadmi Party’ and was a ‘victim of circumstances’, as he had been caught up in a political cross-fire, and the allegations levelled against him were nothing but a political blame game to malign his image.He also contended that the primary witness had initially not named him in his complaint but inculpated him only while recording of his statement by the investigating agency. This, he said, was nothing but merely an “improvement” done at the instance of the investigating agency.“Even if there were no direct acts of violence attributable to the applicant, he cannot shy away from his liability under the provisions of the Sections invoked against him, particularly on account of the fact that his house/building became the hub/centre point for the rioters and rabble-rousers to unleash the worst communal riots since Partition in Delhi,” the court said.The judge stated that he found “ocular evidence” of independent witnesses to be categorical, which gave the clear details qua the active role played by him in the incidents in question.The Call Detail Record analysis of Mr. Hussain’s mobile number confirmed his presence at or around the scene of crimes on the dates of incidents, the court said. It also rejected his contention on the delay in the recording of statements of witnesses by the investigating agency."
37	? Delhi Police Special Cell on Wednesday submitted the third supplementary chargesheet in Delhi riots case in Karkardooma court. The court has yet to take cognisance in the charge sheet filed. The special cell investigating the alleged ‘large-scale conspiracy’ behind the northeast Delhi riots has arrested 15 people under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.A senior police officer said that the third supplementary charge sheet mainly focused on evidences that they got after forensic laboratory report and other technical examinations that were pending in the case.

39	" The Delhi High Court has stayed the trial of 15 accused, including Pinjra Tod activists Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, charged under the anti-terror law Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in connection with
the northeast Delhi riots .
“Till further order, trial is stayed,” Justice Suresh Kumar Kait said while hearing the plea of Delhi Police challenging a trial court’s order directing the agency to provide hard copies of the chargesheet to the 15 accused.Justice Kait also issued notices to all the accused on the police’s plea and posted the case for further hearing on December 15. The Delhi police has challenged the trial court’s September 21 and October 21 orders, directing it to supply the physical
copy of the chargesheet along with documents to the accused.
The plea said the police report itself was running into about 2,700 pages and the total number of documents and statements of witnesses were running into about 18,000 pages and there were 23 volumes, including the police report, which were filed before the trial court.All the accused persons had been given the copy of the chargesheet in pendrive which was a sufficient compliance of the Code of Criminal Procedure. There was a proviso that if any document was voluminous, then instead of furnishing a copy, the court could direct that the person be allowed to inspect it either personally or through a pleader in court, the plea said.The trial court had, however, declined the police’s plea saying, “even though, it may be desirable to have soft copies of the chargesheet, the law still mandates that a hard copy is to be made available to the accused”.Some of the accused persons have sought for a searchable digital copy of the chargesheet and various other chat groups as included in the police’s application. Those who have been chargesheeted under the stringent UAPA Act include Ms. Narwal and Ms. Kalita, former Congress councillor from Jagatpuri Ishrat Jahan, Jamia Coordination Committee media coordinator Safoora Zargar, student activist Gulfisha Khatoon, and social activist Khalid Saifi.The list also includes activist Meeran Haider, Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha, former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, former Jamia student Shifa-Ur-Rahman, and five others — Shadab Ahmed, Tasleem Ahmed, Saleem Malik, Mohd. Saleem Khan and Athar Khan."
40	"A Delhi court on Saturday granted bail to student activist Gulfisha Fatima in a case related to the north-east Delhi communal violence.Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat granted relief to Ms. Fatima on furnishing a bail bond of ?30,000 with one surety of like amount in the case related to rioting in Jafrabad in which one Aaman died due to gunshot injuries.The court granted her bail on the ground of parity as co-accused Jawaharlal Nehru University students and Pinjra Tod members Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal have already been granted the relief in the case.Compensation panelEarlier in the day, Supreme Court Judge Justice Surya Kant inaugurated the North East Delhi Riots Claims Commission for providing compensation to victims of the communal violence. He said in a statement that justice to victims of the riot was the need of the hour.There are about 750 cases registered in north-east Delhi and around 1,200 persons have been arrested in matters related to the riot.Ms. Fatima was in custody in the case since June 3.“The co-accused Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal have been granted bail in this case and their role is stated to be similar to the present applicant/accused [Fatima]. The witnesses for all of them are almost the same.“Considering the period of the custody of the applicant/accused in the present case, the ground of parity as regards co-accused Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal and in the totality of the facts and circumstances of the case, the present bail application of applicant/accused is allowed,” the court said in its order.It further said there was nothing to suggest that the witnesses were under threat from Ms. Fatima. “In any case, two public witnesses are protected and their identity has been concealed. The rest are police personnel,” it said.The court said co-accused Tafsil has been declared a proclaimed offender, but Ms. Fatima cannot be refused bail for his act and conduct, who will face consequences under the law. “The present stage is of bail and not acquittal or conviction. Nothing is shown to suggest that the applicant (Fatima) is a flight risk,” it added. The court directed her not to tamper with evidence or leave the jurisdiction of NCT Delhi with its permission. It also asked her to attend the court on every date of the hearing or as directed. Noting the prosecutor’s submission that she should be denied bail on the ground that she was an accused in a separate case related to the larger conspiracy in the riots, the judge said the case was being investigated separately and the court will “cross the bridge when we come to it“. atima has been arrested under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in a separate case related to premeditated conspiracy in the riots. She is currently lodged in Tihar prison in the matter.During the hearing, advocate Mehmood Pracha, appearing for Ms. Fatima, said she was falsely and maliciously implicated in the present case without any evidence. Mr. Pracha further claimed that no role has been attributed to her except vague and unsubstantiated allegations which have no nexus with the alleged crime. Special Public Prosecutor Rajeev Krishan Sharma, appearing for the police, opposed the bail plea saying Fatima allegedly conspired and has been constantly instigating the local inhabitants since December, 2019, under the garb of peaceful protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register for Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR). He said some of the protected witnesses have allegedly said that Fatima and her accomplices of the Pinjra Tod group used code words to convey secret messages regarding further lines of their protests in front of common people.The public prosecutor alleged that she was physically present at the protest site at 66 Foota Road, under Jafrabad metro station, Delhi, since February 22, 2020, till late evening on February 24 and the roadblock there, which spiralled into a huge communal riot.  Kalita was granted bail in the case by the Delhi High Court on September 1 and Narwal was granted the relief by the trial court on September 17.  Pinjra Tod (Break the Cage) was founded in 2015 to make hostels and paying guest accommodations less restrictive for women students.  Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured."

42	"It is not every day that a judge weaves together vivid and imaginatively crafted words and then rhyme them to describe a crime and the roller coaster journey of judicial proceedings. This is exactly what a local court judge in Delhi did while granting bail to a man, who was arrested in connection with the north-east Delhi riots case.Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat, in a rare display of his poetic side, decided to describe why he thought there was merit in the bail application of one Babu, who has been in custody since April 8 this year, in a “different way”.Mr. Rawat wrote a poem to express it.To appreciate the poem, it is imperative to know that the bail case arises out of the north-east Delhi riots in which one Mr. Rahul suffered a gunshot injury.While Mr Rahul gave a fake address to the police and is now untraceable, the accused, Babu, with a bad antecedent history, was arrested for the offence on the basis of a purported identification by Constable Satish. The court noted that apart from the identification by Mr. Satish of Babu being involved in rioting near Maujpur Red Light towards Jafrabad on February 25, there is nothing much that has been brought on record in connection with the assault case.Taking note of the facts, Mr. Rawat granted bail to Babu with the condition that he will not leave Delhi without prior permission of the court nor shall he indulge in any kind of criminal activity. The judge also ordered Babu not to tamper with any evidence or contact any witness."

ON February 25, 2020, a video shared on several WhatsApp groups in Delhi showed a Hanuman flag (a Hindu religious flag) being hoisted atop a mosque in North East Delhi. Many WhatsApp users sought to dismiss it as a fake video clip, but it soon came to light that the incident happened at the Maula Baksh Masjid in Ashok Nagar near Shahdara. The mosque had come under attack during the week-long riots that began on February 23 and business and residential premises of the Muslim community near it were gutted. Secular forces and some local Left leaders and human rights activists visited the mosque in a show of solidarity with the beleaguered Muslim community.What escaped notice was the blatant attack on the Allahwali Masjid at Karawal Nagar. It was set on fire, a Hanuman flag was hoisted on its minaret, and, an idol of a Hindu deity, Durga, was placed at its entrance. The media, including leading Urdu dailies, failed to report in detail the attempt to turn a mosque into a temple. Amid stories of human deprivation and displacement following the riots, the Allahwali Masjid incident went out of collective memory. In the last week of October, the mosque once again made news, this time for a positive reason. The Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind has restored the mosque to its original glory and handed it over to the community for regular use. The four-storeyed mosque has been given a facelift with Rajasthani tiles and white marble, for the walls and the floor, and Awadhi latticed screen. Besides the daily prayers, it is also hosting the Friday prayers and providing all amenities to devotees. The Jamiat has in its own silent ways foiled a Babri Masjid kind of demolition in Delhi. The attackers of the Allahwali Masjid were reportedly heard saying, “Har masjid Babri”. Similar slogans were heard at the Ashok Nagar and Gokulpuri localities, where too mosques were attacked.Also read: Why do riots erupt?The residents of Shaheed Bhagat Singh colony in Karawal Nagar, where the nearly three-decade-old Allahwali Masjid is located, mainly belong to the majority community unlike in other parts of North East Delhi. The mosque was targeted through a series of actions such as intimidation and provocation followed by violence.Around 11 a.m. on February 25, a mob consisting of local residents and outsiders carrying trishuls and shouting “Jai Shri Ram”, arrived at the mosque forcing the Muslim residents in the area to either lock their gates or flee their premises. The miscreants set the empty houses on fire and then reassembled outside the mosque, which remained closed after Fajr, dawn prayers. At the best of times, the mosque attracted 40 to 50 men for daily prayers and around 500 for Friday prayers. On February 25, only a handful of people showed up for morning prayers, perhaps deterred by the tension in the air.Shouting slogans, the mob began to break the mosque's wall with trishuls, rods and pick axes. The mosque’s gate did not yield as easily as they would have anticipated. Some young men with saffron bandana tied around their heads shouted, “Ek dhakka aur, Allahwali masjid tod do” (one more push, break the mosque). Petrol bombs and gas cylinders were hurled from the pathway inside the mosque's courtyard. The floor, walls and the ceiling were damaged and the prayer rugs were reduced to ashes.A section of the mob then cut the water and electricity connection to the mosque. Others struck at the walls with hammers and iron rods. Some copies of the Koran were found desecrated. However, a shelf full of copies of the Koran, kept near the mimbar (pulpit), was intact. One of the loudspeakers meant for pronouncing the azaan, the daily prayer call, was removed from the minaret and thrown to the ground. An idol of Durga was placed at the threshold of the mosque and a garland of marigold flowers put around it.Also read: Flash in the panEmboldened by the installation of the idol, some young men went to the roof of the mosque and hoisted a Hanuman flag on its minaret. Once again “Jai Shri Ram” and “Har Har Mahadev” slogans rent the air. According to some eyewitnesses, the police did not enter the lane in which the mosque is located. According to others, the police failed in their feeble attempts to control the mob from gathering near the mosque. The police were not seen in the immediate proximity of the place of worship though the mosque's capture itself took more than an hour, and was recorded on camera.A first information report (FIR) was filed only six days later, on March 1, in which no person was named for the attack. Fazlur Rehman of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind said: “Muslim residents of the colony claimed they could recognise some of the men who attacked the masjid, but were too scared to name them.” The Jamiat, which, under its chief Arshad Madani, has been trying to rehabilitate the victims of the violence, helped obtain bail for 16 men in false cases filed against them. Arshad Madani said: “Muslims have to live in the colony. They own houses there, and were understandably not ready to come forward to name the attackers. As a result nobody was named in the attack. More than eight months after the attack, nobody has been arrested or held responsible for the attempt to place idols of a Hindu deity or hoist a bhagwa [saffron-coloured] flag at the mosque.”Attempted demolitionAsjad Hussain, a plywood dealer who offers his morning prayers at the mosque regularly, said: “The attempted demolition of the mosque and its capture were planned to perfection. A similar attempt was made on February 24 but nobody came to our rescue.”Madani said: “A mob gathered at the mosque on February 24 evening. It was armed with hammers, rods and pickaxes, and raised slogans of Jai Shri Ram. The local Muslims had gathered in good numbers as it was prayer time. They foiled the bid to damage the mosque and .shouted Allahu Akbar.”Also read: The aftermath of the Delhi riotsThe next morning, the goons arrived in greater numbers, armed with trishuls, iron rods and hammers, and idols of Durga, Siva and Hanuman. But even after they left the place, no Muslim dared to come out of his house to go the mosque for Zuhr (afternoon) prayers. By February 27, all the Muslim residents fled the colony. The media did not talk about the destruction and displacement. Incidentally, no prayer was offered at the mosque from February 25 until its recent repair and reconstruction. In contrast, the Farooqia Masjid, located two kilometres away, began Friday prayers within 72 hours after it had been set on fire.The Jamiat convinced the Muslims to go back to their houses. It first repaired their houses.Madani said: “It was a long struggle to repair the mosque. The mob had used gas and petrol cylinders to cause a blast at the mosque. Some cylinders burst, others did not. Forget the floor or the ceiling, even the water taps of wuzukhana [place for ablution] had been destroyed. It would have been easier to build a mosque from scratch than to restore the badly damaged mosque.”On March 1, an FIR was filed with the local police station at the behest of the Jamiat. Although no individuals were blamed for the attack, the FIR mentioned the placement of the idol at the threshold and the hoisting of the flag on the minaret of the mosque. Fazlur Rehman said: “Our men went there within hours of the attack. The Jamiat officials met the police and asked them to get the flag and the idol removed from the premises. We told them this action would tell the victims that the police were stepping in to control the damage. The SHO agreed.”Also read: Shape of things to comeSoon, a police team, accompanied by a team from the Special Cell and Jamiat officials, reached the mosque. The local residents objected but the team brushed aside their objections. The police gave permission to remove the flag and the idol, but the Jamiat insisted that it be done by members from the majority community in order to send out a signal of communal harmony.A young man volunteered, and in the presence of the police removed the flag. The idol was wrapped in a clean cloth and given to him.It was only in Ramzan, in May, that repair and reconstruction of the mosque started. The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures delayed the work. The mosque was restored to its original glory at the start of the Islamic month heralding the birth of the Prophet Muhammad. Madani said: “We have repaired the mosque with our own funds. Today, around 25 men can stand together in a row for prayer. There can be eight such rows of worshippers at any given time. We are glad we could protect our masjid.” He said, “We are supporters of peace and communal harmony. That is why, even after the mosque incident, the Jamiat provided relief to all impacted people irrespective of their religion.”Shortly after the Tablighi Jamaat incident in March, the Jamiat’s aid team was stopped in Shiv Vihar in North East Delhi. Some local people accused its volunteers of spreading the coronavirus. The police arrived at the scene and confiscated the list of people in need of relief. But when they discovered that the first 12 names on the list were Hindus, their attitude changed, and they helped provide aid to all. Incidentally, during the February violence, 19 mosques and dargahs were targeted in North East Delhi. But an attempt was made to convert the Allahwali Masjid into a temple. Until March 1, a new garland was placed on the deity every day and wayfarers started to worship the idol. Fazlur Rehman said: “The idea was to repeat Babri Masjid. We are glad we could avert it with timely action.”Also read: Targeting mosques

On January 4, while granting bail to three persons accused of violence in the Northeast Delhi riots of February 2020, a Delhi court made stinging remarks against the police investigation in the matter. Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat, while granting bail to Gulfam alias Sonu Chikna, Aatir, and Osama, stated that the May 22, 2020, charge sheet in the matter was filed in a “very lackadaisical manner”.He observed, “After going through the bail applications, reply and particularly charge sheet, I cannot help but notice the carelessness with which the charge sheet has been prepared and filed. The investigation carried out, is perfunctory. The list of witnesses filed, mentions some witnesses. However, no statement under Section 161 of the Criminal Procedural Code of any of the witnesses has been filed with the charge sheet.”Considering the period of custody undergone by the three, and the nature of investigation and the charge sheet, all three bail applications under Section 439 of the CrPC were approved on bail bonds of Rs 10,000 each.The three were arrested under FIR 107/2020 registered at the Jafrabad Police Station. Aatir and Gulfam were formally arrested on April 8 from Mandoli Jail, while Osama was formally arrested on April 10 from Tihar Jail.They were arrested on the basis of a complaint filed by a fruit seller, Nasir Ahmad, who alleged that on February 25, a group of more than 100 people looted fruits worth Rs2 lakh from his godown in Bhojpur, and burnt two reharis [hand carts]. An FIR was lodged under sections 147, 148, 149, 427, 380, 436 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code.Earlier, too, courts have granted bail to many of those arrested on trumped up charges of rioting in Northeast Delhi on similar grounds of shoddy investigation. For instance, in November, Justice Suresh Kumar Kait granted bail to Saiyad Iftikhar after noting that there were no CDRs [call detail records] to show that he was present at the site of violence on the particular day. The court noted that though Iftikhar has a power of minus 3.75, he was not wearing spectacles in the CCTV footage on the basis of which he was arrested along with co-accused Ali Hasan. “The alleged incident is dated February 24 at 21:31:50 hour. Thus, it cannot be believed that a person having such weak eyesight would have clear vision at night without spectacles. Moreover, CDR is not on record, whereby it could have been established that the petitioner was available at the site,” the court said.Last year, on February 24, communal violence broke out in northeast Delhi leaving at least 53 people dead and more than 400 injured. The violence took place in the backdrop of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019. According to a Delhi Police affidavit filed in the Delhi High Court in July 2020, a total of 1,430 people were arrested for the violence in more than 750 cases.A report titled ‘Delhi Riots of 2020: Causes, Fallout and Aftermath’ edited by Senior Advocate Chander Uday Singh, states: “Though the affidavit takes pains to try and minimise the destruction and arson suffered by Muslims, and seeks to suggest that both Hindus and Muslims suffered, analysis reveals that 40 out of 52 civilian deaths (apart from a Head Constable who died of gunshot injuries), 85-90 per cent of homes destroyed, 80-85 per cent of shops destroyed, and destruction of the vast majority of vehicles, were suffered by the Muslims. An indication of the disproportionate impact of the violence is provided by the fact that the 1,000 people who sought refuge in a relief camp organised at Mustafabad Idgah, and uncounted others who fled to their villages or took shelter in 9 smaller relief camps organised by the Delhi Government, were almost exclusively Muslim.”
"
46	"The Delhi police, in a chargesheet submitted in Jafrabad riots case, stated that they have arrested five persons who were injured in the communal violence.In the document submitted by the police in court on June 2, they stated that a sub-inspector rank officer asked beat staff and informers to identify the accused based on Medico Legal Certificates and videography conducted during the riots in February. “
Jin dangaiyon ko mauke par chot aayi thi unme se paanch giraftaar ho chuke hain veh paanch ki jaankari ve patey MLCs per complete nahin hain… jinhone jaan boojh kar haspatal main apne patey galat diye hain, jo bhaage hue hain, jinpar tafteesh jari hai [Five of those who got injured during riots have been arrested while addresses of five are not complete in their MLCs… they deliberately gave wrong details in hospital, they are absconding and investigation is going on],” the document stated.
The police also stated that “MLCs which were connected to the spot were collected” for investigation purposes.Damaged eye Among the five arrested on charges of rioting, murder, attempt to murder among others, one suffered damage to his eyes during the riots. “An injured person had come near Crescent School and was connected with the incident. When videography of the spot was examined, it was found that he was aggressive and was found pelting stones at policemen several times. When he was interrogated, he said his name was Mohammed Shahrukh (24),” the document stated.Shahrukh was injured during the incident. The police submitted that the clothes he was wearing on the day of the incident have also been recovered. He was arrested on March 5.Humanitarian grounds “On March 6, he was produced before the court, but he was released on bail on humanitarian grounds because one of his eyes was completely damaged and the other was damaged 90%,” the document stated.On March 8, the police arrested Mohammed Gulfam alias Sonu Chikna (23) and apprehended a minor, both of whom were injured during the riots and had their MLCs conducted at different hospitals.On April 7 – during the lockdown – the police submitted that they arrested Shahid from his residence in Welcome based on the MLCs collected in connection with the spot and an “informer”. Clothes he wore at the time of the incident were also recovered.The Hindu  had reported that on April 19, 22-year-old Javed, who was injured during the violence inside Farooqia Masjid, was arrested in connection with the riots. His father, Shokeen Ahmed, blamed getting the MLC done because he suspected that the police reached him because of his record in the hospital.
Several NGOs and lawyers’ collective worked in the area providing legal aid to the families. The families were helped by the groups in getting the MLCs conducted for legal record. "
47	"Former JNU student Umar Khalid has been formally arrested in a second FIR in connection with communal riots that broke out in Delhi in February, his friend Banojyotsna Lahiri said. The arrest was made by the Crime Branch on Wednesday, she said. Crime Branch officials could not be reached for a comment. Ms. Lahiri said the arrest was made in FIR number 101 registered at Khajuri Khas police station under Sections of rioting, mischief by fire, criminal conspiracy, among others, that was being probed by a Crime Branch SIT. Mr. Khalid was interrogated in connection with this case in the first week of September by the Crime Branch. Ms. Lahiri claimed that the lawyers were unaware of the development.  “Today, just hours before his legal
mulaqat , he was whisked away for an appearance before a ‘duty magistrate’ after the arrest in jail. He was told that they would provide him a ‘legal aid counsel’ when he insisted that his ‘legal
mulaqat’  was due in a short while. He even named his lawyers and wanted to talk to them via videoconferencing or over the phone. However, he was not provided the facility and nor was his lawyers informed. His remand hearing was done hurriedly with the aim of denying him access to counsel and his family, friends and lawyers and then presented a fait accompli,” she said.
Mr. Khalid was in judicial custody after being arrested by the Special Cell on charges of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. "
48	"On Sunday night, the Special Cell of the Delhi Police arrested the human rights activist Umar Khalid after interrogating him for 11 hours in the Delhi riots case as a “conspirator”.“Right now, our first priority is that he should be given maximum security and the Delhi Police must ensure his safety by all means,” said Banojyostna Lahiri of United Against Hate (UAH). Her concern was valid given that in 2018, following a sustained media campaign that painted Umar as an “anti-national”, there had been an attempt on Umar’s life in the heart of central Delhi.Since February 2016, Umar was subjected to repeated media trials, through doctored videos in the mainstream media and slander on social media. His father’s association with the Students’Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) has often been used to justify such a profiling of Umar. Dr S.Q.R. Ilyas, a respected cleric and member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, was associated with SIMI until 1985 when it was not a banned organisation and Umar was not even born.In March, shortly after the Delhi riots broke out, Umar, a favourite whipping boy of the right wing, first found his name propped up as a conspirator by the Bharatiya Janata Party’s IT cell head Amit Malviya on Twitter.Amit Malviya had tweeted, “Umar Khalid, already facing sedition charges, gave a speech in Amravati on 17 Feb, where he exhorted a largely Muslim audience to come out on streets in huge numbers when Trump arrives in India on 24th. Was the violence in Delhi planned weeks in advance by the Tukde Tukde gang?”Amit had selectively quoted parts of Umar’s speech, which was in fact, peppered with references to Mahatma Gandhi and peaceful modes of civil disobedience. In Amravati, Umar had said, “We will not respond to violence with violence. We will not respond to hate with hate. If they spread hate, we will respond to it by spreading love. If they beat us with lathis, we will hold aloft the tricolor. If they fire bullets, then we will hold the Constitution and raise our hands. If they jail us, we will go to jail happily singing, ‘Saarey Jahaan Se Acha Hindustan Hamara’. But we will not let you destroy our country.”Soon after Amit Malviya’s social media posts, the accusation was picked up by the mainstream media and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) close to the BJP and they began to paint Umar as a conspirator in the riots. In Parliament, during a discussion on the Delhi riots, BJP MPs, including Home Minister Amit Shah, blamed UAH as an instigator in the riots.Subsequently, in April, the Delhi Police charged Umar under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), implicating him in the riots.Condemning his arrest in the strongest possible terms, civil society members Ravi Kiran Jain, V.. Suresh, Mihir Desai, N.D Pancholi, Prof Satish Deshpande, Prof Mary John, Prof Apoorvanand, Aakar Patel, Harsh Mander, Farah Naqvi, Biraj Patnaik and Prof Nandini Sundar issued a joint statement stating that Umar had been “subjected to a malicious investigation targeting peaceful anti-CAA protestors. He has been booked under several charges including UAPA, sedition and conspiracy for murder. With deep anguish we have no doubt in saying that this investigation is not about the violence in February 2020 in the national capital but on the completely peaceful and democratic protests across the country against the unconstitutional CAA.”Advocate Prashant Bhushan termed the investigation into the Delhi riots “a conspiracy by the police to frame peaceful activists in the guise of investigation. Umar Khalid’s arrest by the Delhi Police after naming [Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram] Yechury, [Swaraj Abhiyan leader] Yogendra Yadav, [the economist] Jayati Ghosh and Delhi University’s Professor Apoorvanand leaves no doubt at all about the mala fide nature of its investigation into Delhi riots,” he said.Days before Umar’s arrest, two disclosure statements had emerged, purportedly made by Pinjra Tod members Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita. The statement named Sitaram Yechury, Yogendra Yadav, Jayati Ghosh, Apoorvanand and filmmaker Rahul Roy.Screen shots of the statements circulating online show that Natasha and Devangana wrote: “I refuse to sign” on the so-called disclosure statements which are not admissible in court but are great fodder for the “media trial” that several activists have said the investigations into Delhi riots have become with selective leaks by the investigating agencies. It was reported that both the statements were nearly identical in language and spelling mistakes and explained how Umar gave them “tips” to protest.Public outrage from several quarters prompted the Delhi Police to issue a clarification that Sitaram Yechury, Yogendra Yadav and Jayati Ghosh were not accused in the case, but they refused to comment on the status of Rahul Roy and Apoorvanand. A day after Umar’s arrest, Rahul Roy and Saba Dewan received summons from the Delhi Police.Reacting to his name being linked to the riots case, Sitaram Yechury tweeted that the Delhi Police was under the Centre and Home Ministry. “Its illegitimate, illegal actions are a direct outcome of the politics of BJP’s top leadership. They are scared of legitimate peaceful protests by mainstream political parties and are misusing state power to target the Opposition,” he said. The CPI(M) politburo issued a statement stating, “The CPI(M) condemns this obnoxious action by the Delhi Police to further the narrative of its political masters and urges the government to desist from such acts of criminalising peaceful political protests.”The investigations into the Delhi riots and the use of the stringent UAPA against the anti-CAA protesters compelled even P. Chidambaram, a key proponent of the draconian national security laws, to react strongly. The senior Congress leader said, “Delhi Police have brought the criminal justice system to ridicule by naming Mr Sitaram Yechury and many other scholars and activists in a supplementary charge sheet in the Delhi riots case. Has the Delhi Police forgotten that between Information and Charge Sheet there are important steps called Investigation and Corroboration?”

49	"On December 24, 2020, the Special Cell of the Delhi Police raided the premises of Mehmood Pracha, the advocate who represents several of those accused in the North-East Delhi violence of February 2020 and Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan who participated in the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests of December 2019. Armed with a local court’s warrant to search for “incriminating documents” and “metadata” from Pracha’s official email account, the police seized his computer and laptop in an operation that began around noon on December 24 and continued into the wee hours of the following day.The police accused Pracha of forging a notary stamp on an official document. A first information report (FIR) had been registered in August, based on the complaint of one Sharif Malik, who claimed that Pracha had told Irshad Ali, the owner of a mattress shop destroyed in the violence, to get Malik as a witness to strengthen Ali’s case. The police claim that Malik’s statement, given along with the shop owner’s, was “false and concocted”, and that Pracha had forged a notary stamp on an official document using the name and stamp of a notary who had been dead for several years. The police also alleged that Pracha had summoned Ali to his office.This was denied by Ali, who told Frontline that it was he who approached Pracha after discovering that the police had wrongfully charged his friends with burning his shop. Earlier, the police had submitted a report before the sessions court, alleging that “Ali stated that one lawyer namely Mehmood Pracha called him to his office and told him about a complainant of a similar incident and there is also an eyewitness Sharif (Malik) who witnessed the whole incident as he was present there on February 24th and 25th.”Also read: Aftermath of the Delhi riotsAli said that he had registered an FIR on February 25 stating that this shop had been looted. Later, he saw the CCTV footage and identified three locals, Mintu, Navneet and Deepak. Ali alleged that the investigating officer had forced him to name his friends, which he had refused to do. Two months later, Ali’s friend Yusuf’s brother Gulfam was arrested for looting his shop although Gulfam had not been seen in the CCTV footage. Following this, Ali approached Pracha with Yusuf’s help and discovered that besides Gulfam, his friends Arshad and Abid, too, had been named as accused and mentioned in the FIR. Ali claimed the investigating officer wrote down the names himself. He asked: “Why would my friends set my shop on fire?”It is about this meeting that the police claimed that Pracha had suggested adding Sharif’s case to Ali’s complaint, a claim rebuffed by both Ali and Pracha. That, however, failed to convince the police, who went on to search Pracha’s premises, an operation that Pracha claims turned ugly and violent. Pracha told Frontline: “Our staff members have recorded a video. We have it on record. We will show [it] at an appropriate time.”Breach of privacyThe said video made its way into social media and was widely shared on Twitter. In the video, Pracha was seen objecting to the seizure of his laptop by the police. He cited the client-attorney privilege and claimed that the seizure of the laptop would be in violation of the court order. Pracha has other clients who have nothing to do with the incidents of violence in North-East Delhi, and he said their privacy, too, had been breached by the police action. He told Frontline: “The order passed by the learned court and the subsequent search order is per se illegal, and clearly violates the client-attorney relationship. It is a patently illegal order by the magistrate. The guidelines passed by the Bar Council of India prohibit an advocate from divulging anything about the client. I am glad I was able to live up to the duty of a lawyer.”As for why the police had seized Pracha’s computer and laptop when they could have accessed the email from Pracha’s outbox, he said: “It is a matter of investigation. I would like to know in what circumstances the order was passed, and what they (Delhi Police) did in the garb of the order. The order specifically talks of one mail which is also part of the client-attorney relationship. I would not have allowed it but for the existing court order. I was in two minds initially. If I had not complied, it would have harmed my client more. So I allowed them access to [the] outbox plus the document they cited, claiming it was sent from our computer. But there were 200 people in all who had come to my office. Twenty of them were with guns and hacking machines. They were here for 15 hours as if they were investigating a robbery. They took all our phones. All our computers were in their possession.”Also read: Lawyer-police tussle in DelhiThe police claimed that Pracha had misbehaved with them and refused to cooperate. The Counter Intelligence Unit of the Delhi Police’s Special Cell lodged an FIR against Pracha under Indian Penal Code Sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging his duty) and 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public function). Even as he denied the police’s claim that he had been abusive and aggressive during the search, Pracha said: “The magistrate’s order was strange. Anything that goes from my computer is received by another computer, by the addressee. And the addressee was the Commissioner of Police. There was actually no justification for this search warrant. …We cooperated to the best of our ability under the circumstances. We unlocked our computers and the office was provided to the police for their investigation. The police personnel directed us to show the material ourselves, and on failure to comply, they threatened to take away the computers. We have everything on record.”In the video, Pracha was seen claiming he had evidence linking members of the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) to the North-East Delhi violence. He said: “We have evidence against about two dozen people, mostly from the RSS. The involvement of the police is now becoming clear. We are trying to ensure that people do not lose faith in the Constitution of India and the judiciary.”Pracha, who said that the search warrant was meant to intimidate him, moved the court for a copy of the videography of the search conducted at his premises. Pracha told the court he was threatened by the investigating officer. The court asked the police to preserve the recording safely. The matter is due to come up for a hearing later in January. However, Pracha is yet to get a copy of the legal recording.Police raid criticisedMeanwhile, the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) expressed “shock, deep concern and dismay” at the search operation and seizure conducted by Delhi Police. It called the Delhi Police raid on Pracha’s premises an arbitrary, illegal and brazen exercise of brute power and the actions taken by them “contrary to law against members of the legal fraternity”.Also read: Policing and private initiativesThe statement issued by the SCBA read: “Search and seizure conducted at the premises of a member of this association is a malicious act which defeats the right of an advocate to practise his profession without fear or favour. Such actions are intimidatory and designed to abuse the due process of law by coercing an advocate to succumb to police threats and methods unheard in legal annals.” The statement added that the police action violated the right of the accused to a fair trial guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.Meanwhile, the Delhi High Court Women Lawyers’ Forum wrote to the Delhi High Court Bar Association expressing concern over investigating agencies arraigning lawyers as the accused in criminal cases. Terming the raids an “act of vindictiveness”, the letter stated: “Raids in the office of Mr Mahmood Pracha is the latest example of intimidation by the Delhi Police. Mr Pracha is representing several accused persons in the recent riot cases in Delhi. The recent trend indicates that there are other lawyers too who are being intimidated and discouraged from representing their clients in these cases. However, this is also a larger issue that goes beyond the riots case, wherein lawyers who are vocal about defending civil liberties are being systematically targeted.”
