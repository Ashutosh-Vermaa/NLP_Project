0,"NEW DELHI: Drawing attention to news broadcasts relating to the Russia-Ukraine war and communal violence in Delhi, the government has asked private TV channels to refrain from using provocative and socially unacceptable language and adhere to the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995 and the programme code. Taking exception to headlines such as âParmanu (nuclear) Putinâ and âAli, Bali aur Khalbaliâ (unrest), a five five-page advisory of the I&B ministry â more in the nature of a warning â reminded channels that the government exercises the right to âregulate or prohibitâ transmission or retransmission of channels in the interest of Indiaâs security, sovereignty, integrity, or in the interest of its friendly ties with a foreign State, or for the sake of âpublic order, decency or moralityâ. Information and Broadcasting Ministry issued advisory for cable TV channels@MIB_India https://t.co/Iort7OF6Vu— Prasar Bharati News Services à¤ªà¥.à¤¬à¥.à¤à¤¨.à¤à¤¸. (@PBNS_India) 1650701578000It said despite existing guidelines, broadcasters carried content that âappears to be inauthentic, misleading, sensational and using socially unacceptable language and remarks, offending good taste and decency, and obscene and defamatory and having communal overtonesâ. âChannels have been making false claims and frequently misquoting international agencies/actorsâ¦Using âscandalous headlines/taglinesâ that are unrelated to the news itemâ¦.Many journalists and news anchors of these channels made fabricated and hyperbolic statements intending to incite audiences,â the advisory said, while referring to coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war on TV. It also cited specific instances of a channelâs âfactless war mongeringâ with claims of Russia giving a 24-hour deadline to launch a nuclear attack on Ukraine, another channelâs claims of the Third World war starting, and yet anotherâs claim that Russian President is carrying a ânuclear briefcaseâ with him. Coverage of communal violence in Delhi, the advisory said, carried âprovocative headlines and videos of violence that may incite hatred among communities and disrupt peace and law and orderâ. It stressed that the broadcast content had the propensity to âdisruptâ on-going investigations by playing âscandalous and unverified CCTV footageâ. It cautioned showing footage of a âspecific communityâ would aggravate communal tensions, while âfabricated headlinesâ were âsensationalising and giving communal colours to the actions of the authorities.â The ministry also cautioned private TV channels against broadcasting news debates carrying âunparliamentary, provocative and socially unacceptable language, communal remarks and derogatory referencesâ that have the propensity to negatively impact viewers and disturb peace at large.

1,"New Delhi: A Delhi court has sought response of police on how the riotous incidents that took place on two different dates in north east Delhi during the February 2020 communal violence have been clubbed in a single chargesheet. Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat directed the investigating officer to be present on the next date of hearing for an explanation and put up the matter for further hearing on July 19. âPerusal of the record reveals that the riotous incidents that had taken place on two different dates â 24.02.2020 and 25.02.2020 â have been clubbed in this single chargesheet, which is not understandable. Therefore, let the IO be summoned for the next date of hearing to explain how a single chargesheet has been filed with regards to the riotous incidents that took place on two different dates,â the court said in the order. The incidents pertain to vandalism and looting of shops at Karawal Nagar during the riots. "
2,"NEW DELHI: Reacting to the allegations about BJP fanning communal violence, the party's Delhi unit chief Adesh Gupta retorted that the so-called ""secular gang"" had joined hands to patronise the rioters. Gupta alleged that those who moved court against the municipal corporation's decision to remove encroachments had among them a Congress member who had opposed the existence of the Lord Rama and a Muslim group that supported Aam Aadmi Party in the assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. ""Those who were involved in the Jahangirpuri riots are being saved by the Congress, AAP and the Left. BJP is the only party that wants to act against those who attacked the participants of the Hanuman Jayanti procession and policemen,"" Gupta told reporters. The Delhi BJP chief added that it was not the first time that an anti-encroachment drive was being carried out in Jahangirpuri. ""It was the seventh such action in that area this month. It was a routine exercise. If anyone is sitting on the pavement or the road, he will be removed by the civic body,"" Gupta argued, wondering why political colour was being given to encroachment clearance. Gupta said the municipal corporation never targeted a particular community or religion but always took action against any illegal encroachments. ""AAP seems to be nervous because the local MLA and the councillor are from their party. They have been protecting the Rohingyas and Bangladeshis and now stand exposed,"" he alleged. BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said that Congress, Left and Aam Aadmi Party, who were crying over the removal of vast encroachments in Jahangirpuri by people of Bangladeshi origin, betrayed their ""green communism mindset"". ""Today the Muslim appeasement nature of Congress, the Marxists and AAP stands exposed,"" Kapoor claimed. He added that the kind of language some AAP leaders had used on social media against the BJP functionaries showed ""the lack of moral upbringing"". Meanwhile, Delhi Congress chief Chaudhary Anil Kumar blamed the BJP-run central government and the AAP state government in Delhi for their complete failure to control the communal riots and indulging thereafter in a blame-game. Kumar added that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal should have visited Jahangirpuri and pacified the people and urged them to maintain peace. The Congress also demanded a fair and impartial probe into last Saturday's violence and identify the guilty so they could face appropriate punishment. Former Congress MLA Anil Bhardwaj blamed the saffron party as well as AAP for indulging in ""divisive and communal politics"". Congress spokesperson Naresh Kumar said BJP and AAP should respect the law of the land and the decisions of the courts, instead of defying them to further their interests. "
3,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police has opposed before the Delhi High Court a plea of former JNU student Umar Khalid seeking bail in a case under the stringent UAPA for alleged conspiracy behind the 2020 riots in Delhi, saying the narratives sought to be created by him cannot be looked into as his defence at the this stage. In its reply filed to the plea which challenges the rejection of Khalid's bail application by the trial court, the police stated that the trial court has ""rightly dismissed"" Khalid's plea for release by a ""well-reasoned order"" which suffers from no illegality. ""It is most respectfully submitted that the appeal raises no good grounds for consideration by this hon'ble court and thus the same be dismissed, in the interest of justice,"" stated the reply filed through special public prosecutor Amit Prasad. ""At the stage of bail, the narratives sought to be created by the Appellant cannot be looked into as his defence. The Appellant before the Ld. Trial Court raised ipse dixit arguments seeking to conduct a mini trial at the stage of deciding the bail application and to view the appellant's role in isolation in the case of conspiracy which is impermissible in law,"" it added. In the reply, the Delhi Police further claimed that the length and breadth of the conspiracy and role played by different entities, WhatsApp groups and individuals in pursuance to the conspiracy behind the riots would be clearly demonstrated by the trial court orders rejecting bail to the other co-accused in the case. The police also sought the court's permission to rely on the underlying material from the charge sheets to oppose the bail plea. It also said it ""strongly refutes the allegation that the prosecution has dropped any allegation as is contained in the charge sheet"" against Khalid or any of other co-conspirators. Khalid and several others have been booked under the anti-terror law in the case for being the ""masterminds"" of the February 2020 riots, which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured. The violence had erupted during the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens. Khalid sought bail in the case on the ground that he was not present when the violence broke out, no money was recovered from him and the case is based on cooked up statements. Last week, the high court had granted three days' time to the Delhi Police to file its short reply to the bail application filed in the case and listed the case for further hearing on April 27. The court had held that Khalid's speech given in Amravati in February 2020, which formed the basis of the case against him, was obnoxious, prima facie not acceptable and that certain statements in the speech were ""offensive per se"". On March 24, the trial court had denied bail to Khalid, saying there were reasonable grounds to believe that the accusations against him were prima facie true. Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat had noted from the charge sheet that there was a premeditated conspiracy of a disruptive 'chakka jam' and a pre-planned protest at 23 different sites which was to escalate and result in riots. ""On the perusal of the charge sheet and accompanying documents, for the limited purpose of the bail, I am of the opinion that allegations against the accused Umar Khalid are prima facie true,"" the trial court had said. It had rejected the contention that Khalid was a researcher and that his bent of mind can be assessed from his doctoral thesis on Welfare aspects of Adivasis of Jharkhand and other writings, saying it was not a relevant consideration while deciding the bail application. ""The target was to block roads at mixed population areas and encircle the entire area completely stopping the entry and exit of citizens living there and then creating panic to attack on police personnel by women protesters in front only followed by other ordinary people and engulfing the area into a riots and the same would be covered by the definition of terrorist act,"" the court had noted. The trial court had also rejected the contention made by defence counsel that Khalid was part of the WhatsApp group 'MSJ' and 'DPSG' but he had not written many messages in those groups and they are not overtly provocative or incriminatory, saying the fact that he was part of such groups created for specific objects and his acts or presence throughout the period beginning from the passing of the CAB Bill in December 2019 till the February 2020 riots has to be read in totality and not piecemeal. Besides Khalid, activist Khalid Saifi, JNU students Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, Jamia Coordination Committee members Safoora Zargar, former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain and several others have also been booked under the stringent law in the case. "
4,"NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has granted bail to former Congress MP Sajjan Kumar in a twin-murder case related to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, while noting that his name was first taken with certainty by the complainant after a long gap of seven years from the date of the incident. The present case relates to the killing of a man and his son residing in west Delhiâs Raj Nagar during the riots. As per the prosecution, Kumar was allegedly leading the mob and upon his instigation and abetment, the mob had burnt alive the two men, set fire to their house, and inflicted severe injuries on those staying there. Special judge M K Nagpal granted the relief to Kumar on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 1 lakh with two sureties of like amount. The court directed him to surrender his passport before it and not to leave the country without its permission. It further directed him not to tamper with evidence in the case. It said that it has been observed on perusal of records that there are various and different versions of incident as narrated by the complainant and the other two victims of the case and during the initial period of around one year, there was even no specific statement or claim made by any of them regarding their being eye-witnesses of the alleged incident of killing of the above two deceased by a mob and it is only thereafter, that such a claim was made for the first time by the complainant. "
5,"New Delhi: A Delhi court has framed charges of rioting and unlawful assembly against a man in a north east Delhi riots case, noting that though there has been an inordinate delay in recording statements of the witnesses by the police, the entire case cannot be thrown away at this stage without giving the prosecution an opportunity to explain the delay during the trial. The case pertains to vandalism and pelting of stones on the police, vehicles and Shiv temple and causing damage to public property at Dayalpur area on February 25, 2020. Chief metropolitan magistrate Arun Kumar Garg said prima facie there was sufficient material on record to frame charges of rioting against Gulfam. TNN "
6,"NEW DELHI: Razing the residence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and the BJP headquarters using bulldozers will free the country from communal violence and riots forever, the AAP said on Wednesday, slamming the saffron party for the demolition of several structures in Delhi's Jahangirpuri. Jahangirpuri Demolition Drive Live UpdatesThe Arvind Kejriwal-led party alleged that it was the BJP that had engineered clashes between two communities in Jahangirpuri during a Hanuman Jayanti procession last week as well as other such incidents of violence in various parts of the country during Ram Navami. With the sole motive of triggering communal violence and riots, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) got Rohingyas and Bangladeshis ""illegally"" settled in different parts of the country over the last eight years, the AAP alleged. Similarly, BJP leaders and officials of the saffron party-ruled civic bodies in Delhi got Rohingyas and Bangladeshis ""illegally"" settled in the national capital over the last 15 years, it alleged and demanded that the houses of these leaders and officials should also be demolished using bulldozers. ""The BJP is saying violence, riots and hooliganism will stop by running bulldozers and removing encroachments. But actually, the BJP itself is engineering hooliganism, violence and riots not just in Delhi, but across the country,"" Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Atishi said in a video message. She alleged that Shah and the BJP were behind all the recent incidents of communal violence in various parts of the country during Hanuman Jayanti and Ram Navami celebrations. ""Bulldozers should be run on the BJP headquarters and on the residence of Amit Shah. After this, riots will not happen in this country,"" the Kalkaji MLA said. Her remarks came after bulldozers razed several structures in Jahangirpuri during an anti-encroachment drive conducted by the BJP-ruled North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) amid a heavy deployment of paramilitary and police personnel until the authorities received ""a written order"" from the Supreme Court to stop it. The apex court stayed the anti-encroachment drive and also agreed to hear a petition challenging the civic body's action allegedly aimed against those involved in Saturday's communal clashes in the area. The anti-encroachment drive, however, continued for an hour and a half in the area in northwest Delhi even after the court directed the authorities to stop it. A civic official, requesting anonymity, said the drive continued due to the absence of a written order from the Supreme Court and it was stopped as soon as the order was received. Lashing out at the saffron party over the anti-encroachment drive, AAP's chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said, ""The BJP government at the Centre got Rohingyas and Bangladeshis illegally settled in different parts of the country in the last eight years. The state governments could not have done it as only the Centre can bring them inside the country."" He said the BJP should disclose where all it got Rohingyas and Bangladeshis settled illegally. ""We believe that the BJP has got them settled at various places with the sole motive of engineering riots, using them,"" the AAP MLA added. Earlier, AAP leader Amanatullah Khan alleged that the NDMC had scheduled the anti-encroachment drive in Jahangirpuri as Shah and the BJP want to disturb the peaceful atmosphere of Delhi. In a video message on Twitter, the Okhla MLA said the demolition of houses belonging to members of ""a particular community"" only to ""harass"" them during the holy month of Ramzan on the pretext of an anti-encroachment drive will further spoil the atmosphere in the area. He appealed to the Union home minister and BJP leaders to refrain from resorting to such a move. ""Such cheap politics will ruin the country if not stopped in time,"" Khan, who is also the Delhi Waqf Board chairman, said. Jahangirpuri witnessed violent clashes, including stone pelting, arson and firing, between two communities during a Hanuman Jayanti procession on Saturday. Eight police personnel and a local resident were injured in the clashes. ""The atmosphere in the country has already been vitiated and efforts are being made to make it worse. Amit Shah and the BJP want to disturb the peaceful atmosphere of Delhi,"" Khan said. ""Just four days ago, there was a riot in Jahangirpuri. An order has now been issued to run bulldozers on houses in the area and harass the members of a particular community in the name of an anti-encroachment drive,"" he added. Questioning the timing of the move and the BJP-led Centre's intention behind it, Khan said the civic body could have taken up the anti-encroachment drive later, ""if it is legal"". ""It is the holy month of Ramzan. What is your compulsion that you are going to demolish the houses of people, as you did in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, in the name of launching an anti-encroachment drive in an area hit by rioting just four days ago and when the tempers are yet to cool down? ""This is not right. I appeal to Amit Shah and all the BJP leaders to refrain from resorting to such actions and vitiating the atmosphere of Delhi,"" Khan said. "
7,"NEW DELHI: Aam Aadmi Party MLA Atishi on Thursday said that the party is going to carry out a nationwide survey, where respondents would be asked if they believe that Bharatiya Janata Party is creating riots and hooliganism throughout the country, and if they agree that AAP is a party of honest and educated people. âOver the past few months, a series of harrowing and worrisome incidents have been taking place at various locations across Delhi as well as the entire country. We are witnessing a surge in examples of hooliganism and reckless violence all over India,â Atishi said in a press conference. âAAP is launching a nationwide survey concerning the terror and fear that has spread throughout India as a result of BJPâs relentless hate mongering,â she said. âNow, each and every Indian is sick and tired and tortured by the BJPâs everlasting hunger for violence and spewing hatred,â she alleged. âVery recently, BJP goons attacked the chief ministerâs residence in Delhi, vandalised the premises and made an attempt on the CMâs familyâs life,â the MLA claimed. âNow, the latest example of BJPâs hate mongering and violence is unfolding in front of our eyes at the Jahangirpuri area in Delhi, where their leaders and workers incited riots, their local leader Ansar was caught red-handed and is now a prime accused in the case,â she alleged. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor, however, said: âToday, AAP stands exposed as a communal tension spreader party and to divert public attention and mislead people, AAP leader Atishi has announced launching of a survey, but people will totally reject it.â âWhenever AAP gets caught in a political turmoil, its leaders start talking of public discourse or a survey, but the verdict of people in recent elections in which people gave BJP two-third majority in three states is much above AAPâs sponsored survey,â he said.

Md Farid (31), alias Neetu, was picked up from his auntâs residence late on Wednesday. Two others were also arrested in Jahangirpuri â brothers Zafar and Babuddin, who are associates of Mohammad Ansar, one of the prime conspirators already in the police net. The two were caught on CCTV holding swords aloft hurling petrol bombs at the Hanuman Jayanti procession.Farid has been brought to Delhi and will be confronted with Ansar. Sources said a five-member Delhi Police team, which had been camping in East Midnapore for several days, carried out the arrest based on technical leads.The accusedâs sister, Samina Bibi, said that Farid had little connection with Bengal. âHe was born and brought up in Delhi. He runs a meat shop there and has been the familyâs main breadwinner since our parents passed away. He was at Jahangirpuri and had tried to stop those pelting stones. He realized he was being framed and decided to come here out of fear,â she said.Samina said she hadnât been allowed to meet her brother.Sources in Delhi Police said that Crime Branch and Special Cell teams had been looking for Farid after he was seen in one of the videos. A senior Delhi Police officer said: âWe have evidence that Farid was involved in the riots and is one of the conspirators. We recovered CCTV footage and videos from social media and locals. The accused is seen firing. He fled his home in Jahangirpuri and has been hiding in Tamluk.âCops claimed that Farid had been involved in six cases of robbery and burglary as well as the Arms Act since 2010.(With inputs from Rajshekar Jha in New Delhi)"
9,"NEW DELHI: Itâs been two years since the north-east Delhi riots, but many of the affected people are still running around incessantly, submitting documents to the sub-divisional magistrate, hoping for compensation that they feel is their due. Some such hopefuls told TOI that they had worn out their shoes visiting the district administrative offices, only to be dismissed with a string of excuses about their cases. Mustafabad resident Arifâs boutique tailoring shop in Mahalakshmi Enclave was burnt down on February 25, 2020. âI suffered losses of around Rs 6 lakh. I filed an FIR and visited the SDMâs office and was told I needed to fill some forms. This was done, but nothing has happened so far,â said Arif. âI have had to make my sons aged 13 and 15 years quit school and work to make ends meet. We also had to sell the jewellery we had saved for my daughterâs wedding. Only one thing remains for me to do: consume poison and die.â Itâs not just Arif who is at his witâs end. Many others too are in the same predicament. While some have been asked to produce documents that perished when their houses were destroyed by the mobs, others have been instructed to submit photographic proof of the attack on their properties, which they donât have having fled from their houses for days altogether. Shezad Ashgar Zaidi, 50, whose electronics and computer store was looted on February 25 two years ago, said he went to his ransacked shop to locate his education certificates. âEverything, including laptops and other equipment, were gone and whatever remained had been burnt down. I couldnât find my certificates,â said Zaidi. âI did click some photographs as a record of things that were stolen or burnt, but a mob attacked me and only set me free after I deleted those pictures. How is one supposed to get proof in such a scenario?â Zaidi claimed having filled several forms and received Rs 5,000 as compensation. âWhen one has lost not only stocks worth lakhs of rupees but livelihood itself, how is this puny sum going to help? I approached MLAs and MPs, to no avail,â sighed Zaidi. Mohammad Aslam Khan, 49, resident of Shiv Vihar, ran for his life and the rioters took away his two motorcycles and everything from his house. âWe filled forms, provided our bank account numbers, but we have received no help,â he said. âMy two bikes only cost around Rs 2 lakh, but the mob also took everything from our home, our fridge, TV and all other essential things. I have four children and donât know how to secure their future.â Najis, 33, and her husband, Aseen, 35, suffered a similar fate. The Shiv Vihar residents were lucky to be saved by their Hindu neighbour but lost all their household items. âThe rioters broke the rear wall of our house and carted away our belongings. We stayed at Idgah for a month before returning home,â revealed Najis. âMy husband suffers dizzy spells frequently and canât do much work. We have four children and we are surviving on help from here and there.â Idgah provided temporary residence for a month to Ashrafi Begum, 60, and her husband, Zaleel Khan, too. âThe rioters stole the Rs 3 lakh we had collected for our daughterâs wedding as well as the house registry papers,â claimed Begum. âThe officials asked us to show proof of the stolen cash and jewellery. We showed pictures of our sonâs wedding to prove the jewellery was ours but had no evidence of the cash. This only got us a small sum as compensation.â Several similarly struggling families in Shiv Vihar are seeking help from Neev-Foundation for Legal Aid. âMost cases for compensation are stagnant in Delhi High Court. Two years after the riots, we are still getting requests for sustenance from the victims,â said Mishika Singh, founder-chairperson, Neev. "
10,"NEW DELHI: A local court has framed charges against 10 persons in a Delhi riots case, saying they were members of an unlawful assembly formed with an objective to create fear and panic amongst the Hindu community and threaten them to leave the country. According to the police, the 10 accused men resorted to violence and loot, and set ablaze the properties belonging to ""members of the Hindu community"" at Delhi's Bhagirathi Vihar area on February 25, 2020. Relying on the statements of witnesses, Additional Sessions Judge Virender Bhat said, ""Material on record prima facie discloses that the accused were the members of an unlawful assembly which had been formed with the object to create fear and panic amongst the people belonging to Hindu Community, to threaten them to leave the country and to cause arson, loot."" The judge, in an order dated December 13, framed charges against Mohd Shahnawaz, Mohd Shoaib, Shahrukh, Rashid, Azad, Ashraf Ali, Parvez, Mohd Faisal, Rashid, and Mohd Tahir. It has invoked sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 436 (mischief by fire), 452 (house-trespass with preparation to assault), 454 (lurking house-trespass), 392 (robbery), 427 (mischief) read with Section 149 (unlawful assembly) of the Indian Penal Code. The FIR was registered on a complaint filed by one Jagdish Prasad who said the rioters burnt his son's auto spare parts shop. Prasad also claimed that the mob threw a petrol bomb into the shop as a result of which it got burnt. He further stated that he, along with his two brothers, managed to escape from the rear gate to save their lives. Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi in February 2020 after violence between the supporters of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and those protesting against it spiraled out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured. "
11,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Monday refused to grant bail to an accused in a case concerning the northeast Delhi riots of 2020, saying that there was ""pre-planned and pre-meditated conspiracy to disturb law and order in the city"" and events ""did not take place in a spur of the moment"". Justice Subramonium Prasad, while dealing with a bail application moved by one Mohd Ibrahim in the case concerning the alleged murder of Delhi Police head constable Ratan Lal, observed that there was a systematic disconnection and destruction of the CCTV cameras in areas near the place of the incident and ""innumerable rioters ruthlessly descended with sticks, dandas, bats, etc. upon a hopelessly outnumbered cohort of police officials"". ""The riots which shook the National Capital of the country in February 2020 evidently did not take place in a spur of the moment, and the conduct of the protestors who are present in the video footage which has been placed on record by the prosecution visibly portrays that it was a calculated attempt to dislocate the functioning of the Government as well as to disrupt the normal life of the people in the city,"" the court said. ""The systematic disconnection and destruction of the CCTV cameras also confirm the existence of a preplanned and pre-meditated conspiracy to disturb law and order in the city,"" it added. Dismissing the bail application of Ibrahim, the court stated that the available video footage showing the petitioner with the sword was ""quite egregious"" and sufficient to keep him in custody. ""A perusal of the material on record has revealed to the court that the petitioner has been identified on multiple CCTV footages, carrying a sword and instigating the crowd. The clinching evidence that tilts this Court towards prolonging the incarceration of the Petitioner is that the weapon which is being carried by the Petitioner is capable of causing grievous injuries and/or death, and is prima facie a dangerous weapon,"" the court stated. The judge while acknowledging the importance of personal liberty in a democratic polity, clarified that ""individual liberty cannot be misused in a manner that threatens the very fabric of civilized society by attempting to destabilise it and cause hurt to other persons"". ""Even though the petitioner cannot be seen at the Scene of Crime, he was a part of the mob for the sole reason that the Petitioner had consciously traveled 1.6 km away from his neighborhood with a sword which could only be used to incite violence and inflict damage,"" the court said. The petitioner, Ibrahim, was arrested in December 2020 and has been in judicial custody since then. He sought bail on the ground that he never participated in any protest or the riots at any point in time and the place on a record by the prosecution did not place him anywhere close to the scene of the crime. The court, in a separate order, granted bail to one Saleem Khan, saying that in the absence of any material to show that he was a part of the unlawful assembly at the crime scene, the veracity of the allegations levelled against him can be tested during trial.

12,"NEW DELHI: A Delhi has granted bail to four people in three murder cases related to the northeast Delhi riots after the sole eyewitness did not identify the accused during his deposition. Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat granted relief to Ashok Kumar, Jitender Kumar, Ajay and Shubham on furnishing a bail bond of Rs 10,000 with one surety of like amount each. The accused had sought bail after witness Shashi Kant did not identify them. The court noted that keeping in mind the nature of the deposition of the witness, the special public prosecutor, appearing for police, fairly submitted that he had no objection to the bail applications. ""Considering the nature of the testimony of witness Shashi Kant, which was recorded in this case and taking into account no objection given by the SPP, the bail application is hereby allowed,"" it said in similar orders passed on the three cases related to rioting in Dayalpur. It directed the accused not to leave the territory of NCT of Delhi during the trial and to appear before the court on each and every date of hearing. The cases relate to the alleged murder of Ashfaaq, Zakir and Mehtab, who were caught and severely beaten up by a mob during the communal violence on February 25, 2020, which ultimately led to their death. A perusal of the postmortem report of deceased Zakir revealed that he had received as many as 22 injuries, out of which seven injuries were so grave in nature that they itself were sufficient to cause death of any person in ordinary course of nature. A review of the postmortem of Ashfaaq revealed that he had received 31 injuries, out of which one injury was sufficient to cause death under ordinary circumstances. All the injuries were fresh before death. Some of the injuries were caused by a sharp-edged weapon and the rest were due to application of the blunt force. The postmortem of Mehtab showed that he had received 11 injuries, out of which three injuries were opined to be caused by a sharp-edged sword and were so grave in nature that they itself were sufficient to cause death of any person in ordinary course of nature. At the stage of hearing of their earlier bail arguments, the court had noted that the eyewitness, who was a resident of the locality, had duly identified the accused allegedly indulging in rioting while one of them was carrying a sword.

14,"NEW DELHI: A court in Delhi on Wednesday deferred its order on the immediate release of JNU students Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal, who have been granted bail by the high court in the riots 'conspiracy' case, for Thursday. ""Order could not be passed due to the heavy board of bail applications listed before the undersigned. Be put up for orders tomorrow at 11 am,"" additional sessions judge Revinder Bedi stated. Delhi riots: High court grants bail to student activists, says state blurred lines between right to protest & an act of terrorEarlier in the day, the judge had reserved the order on their application for today after hearing lengthy arguments from the prosecution and counsel for the accused. On Tuesday the Delhi high court had granted bail to Narwal, Kalita and Jamia Millia Islamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha and directed them to furnish a personal bond of Rs 50,000 each along with two sureties of the like amount. After the bail, two women activists moved the trial court seeking their immediate release from jail. The Delhi police during the course proceeding sought more time from the court to verify their addresses, sureties and authenticity of the Aadhaar cards before releasing them on bail. The judge was further apprised that three days would be required to complete the verification process. Advocate Adit Pujari, representing the accused, objected to it and alleged that the police was intentionally delaying their release despite the order of the high court. ""You are keeping them in illegal custody. I have been granted bail and 24 hours have passed since then,"" he said. The three student activists were arrestedMay 2020 were accused of being the ''masterminds'' of the February 2020 violence. 53 people were killed in the riots and hundreds injured. They were arrested under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The Delhi Police has moved the Supreme Court challenging the high court judgements granting them bail in the case. "
15,"NEW DELHI: Shahrukh Pathan, who had allegedly pointed a gun at a police head constable during the 2020 Delhi riots, on Thursday told a court that he did not fire shots at the cop and merely wanted to scare him and not kill, a claim opposed by the prosecution. A photograph of Pathan pointing a gun at Delhi Police head constable Deepak Dahiya had gone viral on social media during the communal riots last year.  He was arrested on March 3, 2020, and is currently lodged in Tihar Jail. To show that there was no attempt to murder the cop, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy, representing Pathan, played a 26-seconds long video of the incident in the court and said that the accused fired two shots - one in the air and second to his right, following which he had a heated conversation with Dahiya and turned back. Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat then asked the lawyer to replay the video and pointed towards the position of Pathan's gun just before he shot fire in the air.  ""Look at the position of his gun. It is not pointed up. It is straight [at Dahiya]. When he is taking the aim, it is straight,"" the judge noted. The advocate, however, clarified that neither of the two gunshots was aimed at the head constable.  ""The state's case is based on Dahiya. He is the potential victim and is not fired at. The first is in the air and the second is on the right,"" she said. Guruswamy added, ""If I (accused) wanted to shoot him, I would have but that was not the intention. The accused turned around and ran away. Does any of this demonstrate the intention to kill or shoot him? At best, this is the intention to scare."" Pathan's counsel said that he did not shoot Dahiya but instead asked him to step back.  ""We had a conversation as heated as it can be and then we retreated. Where is the intention to kill?"" she submitted. She further said, ""I had ample opportunity in this 26 seconds to kill Dahiya or to say the least to injure him. I am trying to scare him. Objectionable as it is for a citizen to scare a police officer, Section 307 IPC [attempt to murder] is not made out because I had no intention to kill."" Special Public Prosecutor Anuj Handa, appearing for the police, said that the accused had clearly pointed the gun at the cop. Opposing Guruswamy's arguments that Pathan had no intention to kill the cop, Handa said, ""The gun is pointed slightly downwards directly at the head of the complainant. His hand going upwards is because of the recoil after shots are fired."" ""The question I ask myself is this, during the first part of the video, he shoots at the different directions of the mob, who might be belonging to the different community. Suppose any person would have succumbed to the injuries, would the offence not have been made out?"" the prosecutor asked. Pathan is facing charges of offences such as rioting with a deadly weapon, an attempt to murder, assault, and obstructing public servants in the discharge of duty under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Arms Act. Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi in February 2020, after violence between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and its protesters spiraled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured. "
16,"NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has framed charges of murder and rioting against 12 people for the lynching of a man during the 2020 Delhi riots, reports Usha Das.  The prosecution told additional sessions judge Virender Bhat that the accused were members of an unlawful assembly on February 25 and 26, and their aim was to avenge the death of some members of their community. To this end, they allegedly bludgeoned one Aas Mohammad to death. The special public prosecutor, appearing for Delhi Police, submitted that messages sent on a WhatsApp group during the riots clearly reveal the 12 had hatched a conspiracy. The counsel for the accused conceded the charges for all the offences except that of criminal conspiracy. Charges framed under Section 144 Later, additional sessions judge Virender Bhat framed charges against the accused under sections 144 (joining unlawful assembly armed with deadly weapon), 147 and 148 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 302 (murder) IPC. He, however, discharged all of them from the charge of criminal conspiracy. "
17,"NEW DELHI: A court has framed charges of rioting and other offences against three men for allegedly setting a mosque on fire during the northeast Delhi riots, noting that the delay in recording the statements of two witnesses couldn't be held fatal to the prosecution case at the stage of deciding charges. Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat framed charges of rioting, unlawful assembly and arson against Deepak, Prince and Shiv for allegedly vandalising and setting the Janati mosque on fire on February 24, 2020 in Gokalpuri. ""No doubt, the statements of these two witnesses have been recorded on September 5, 2021, but they have clearly mentioned that they did not disclose the incident to police on account of fear and it is when police reached their shop in Ganga Vihar for making inquiries regarding their complaint in (another) case that they garnered courage to make a statement in this case,"" the court said on February 11. It also noted that constables Raksh and Vipin stated that when they reached Ganga Vihar along with the investigating officer on March 9, 2020, head constable Mahesh had told them that these three rioters, along with two associates, who allegedly committed vandalisation and arson in the mosque, were present in the A block park. Mahesh had identified all of them in a CCTV footage given to him by a secret informer, the cops said. Police arrested the accused after this, and ""therefore, it cannot be said the arrest of the accused on March 9, 2020 was without any evidence"", the court pointed out. ""The evidence was there in the shape of video footage... though the CD containing it was seized by the investigating officer on the next day,"" it added. The counsel for the accused had argued that the initial chargesheet was filed without any evidence against them and two of the witnesses were planted later. "
18,"NEW DELHI: With more bodies being recovered from drains and people in hospitals dying of injuries, the death toll in the north-east Delhi communal riots rose to 38 on Thursday. However, no incident of violence has been reported since Tuesday night and life is slowly returning to normal. Prohibitory orders imposed under Section 144 will be relaxed for 10 hours on Friday in view of the improvement in the ground situation. Delhi Police has arrested over 130 people, detained over 400 and registered 48 FIRs. It has also booked Aam Aadmi Party councillor Tahir Hussain and his associates in the case of murder of Intelligence Bureau official Ankit Sharma. He is yet to be arrested. Sharmaâs case, along with other cases of riots, have been transferred to the crime branch and a special investigation team (SIT) â as reported by TOI on Thursday â has been set up to probe the case. Delhi violence: Live updatesThe SIT will also probe a âlarger conspiracyâ, which cops suspect was hatched over a period. Their suspicion has been strengthened by the recoveries made from the area which include improvised hand grenades tied with rope and âbottle bomb launchersâ which resemble a big-size slingshot tied to trees or fences to make it look like swings. These arrangements could not have been made overnight, said a source. Meanwhile, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Thursday that Delhi government will bear all medical expenses of the riot victims even if they are admitted to private hospitals and give up to Rs 10 lakh as compensation to the kin of the dead and up to Rs 5 lakh each to those who have lost their houses and shops in the riots. Eighteen subdivisional magistrates (SDMs) have been deployed to monitor the relief and rehabilitation operations. The Delhi LG on Thursday reviewed the situation and directed the police to ensure continued and adequate deployment of force apart from carrying out enhanced patrolling and area domination exercises. Four teams of Delhi FSL â physics, biology, chemistry and photo â visited several spots in the area to lift samples. The authorities will now make efforts for quick disposal of burnt vehicles, lifting of malba, clearing of animal carcasses and repair of roads, signages, government assets and religious structures, in coordination with the police. âThe LG has also asked for setting up of sufficient number of shelter homes with basic amenities, including beddings, blankets, medicines, food, sanitation and clean drinking water, ensuring timely medico-legal certificates and post-mortem reports etc. to the victims and their families,â said a government official. The principal secretary (law) was asked to coordinate with the district legal services authorities to provide immediate legal aid to the victims. Arrangements are being made in coordination with IHBAS for counselling of riot victims to treat those with post-traumatic stress disorder and any other issues. The LG has also asked the revenue department to adopt confidence-building measures and make a quick survey of the quantum of loss to individuals, families, business establishments, shops and institutions and ensure speedy compensation. Special CP Sundari Nanda, assisted by East Delhi Municipal Corporation officials, health department and district administration, will meet the injured and families of the deceased personally and ensure that all steps are taken to provide them help. Delhi Police has appealed to people residing in north-east Delhi that if they had witnessed violent incidents, they should come forward and share their ordeal and videos with the police. The locals can also send videos and pictures through WhatsApp on two mobile numbers â8750871221 and 8750871227. Watch Delhi riots: Bodies found in drains, death toll rises to 38"
19,"NEW DELHI: Activist Khalid Saifi, accused in a case related to the larger conspiracy in northeast Delhi violence in 2020, on Wednesday told a court that Delhi police was attempting to communalise the matter. He made the submissions through his counsel before Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat, who reserved the order on his bail application. Senior Advocate Rebecca John, appearing for Saifi, told the court that the evidence produced by the Delhi police did not add up as it was based on conjectures and surmises. The senior advocate referred to the submission made by the prosecution that protest was communal, was not organic and it was a conspiracy of silence. ""My friend (public prosecutor) said protests were communal, not organic. Let us assume, even if it was not organic. Protests are organised. So what? Prosecution has sought to communalise this case. One community (was) affected by this bill (Citizenship (Amendment) Act). It is their right to protest"", she said. ""Why is prosecution attempting to communalize the narrative? Don't lay the narrative on one community. Don't brush aside the actions of Delhi Police, that too apparent from a reading of this WhatsApp group,"" the counsel said. She referred to a message which read Delhi Police breaking public cameras to avoid accountability. ""But no investigation was made into this,"" she said. John further submitted that the prosecution was relying on some chats in the Delhi Protest Support Group (DPSG). She shared the screenshot of a message sent by Khalid Saifi in the group which read, 'open, clear, inaction of police for the violence. The CM must be held accountable for the same. Protest must be held outside his residence.' ""How this incriminates me (Saifi) beats my reasoning or imagination. I own the message,"" she said. The court, meanwhile, adjourned the arguments on the bail plea of former JNU student Umar Khalid for Friday on a plea by his counsel. She further submitted that none of the ingredients under section 15 ( terrorist act) and section 17 ( terror funding) UAPA, levelled against Saifi, were met. Even for Section 18 (conspiracy to commit Terrorist Act) of UAPA were not satisfied, the counsel said. Saifi, along with several others, has been booked under the anti-terror law in the case for being the ""masterminds"" of the February 2020 riots, which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured. The violence had erupted during the protests against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens. Besides him, former JNU student leader Umar Khalid, JNU students Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita, Jamia Coordination Committee members Safoora Zargar, former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain and several others have also been booked under the stringent law in the case.

21,"NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court on Tuesday pulled up police over their investigation into an incident in which a 23-year-old man was killed after being forced to sing the national anthem during the 2020 northeast Delhi riots. The status report submitted by police is âneither here nor thereâ, the court said. Justice Mukta Gupta also questioned police over the increased number of injuries â 20 â recorded in the postmortem report of the deceased, Faizan, compared with the medical report prepared prior to his detention in police custody where only three injuries were mentioned. âYou have done your level best? These were five children who were assaulted. One has died and four are surviving. Have you got it identified from them? In any case, police will start the investigation from an eyewitness. It is an offence of murder, right? In this case, you have not taken the help of eyewitnesses, but have gone all over the world,â the court said. It said that till date, police had not bothered to take the statements of the eyewitnesses or recorded the statement of the five accused seen beating the victim in the video. âWhat kind of investigation have you done?â Appearing for the victimâs mother, Kismatun, advocate Vrinda Grover contended that police filed the status report in a sealed cover though there was no such direction from the court. The incident relates to a video in which Faizan could be seen allegedly being beaten by policemen while being forced to sing the national anthem and say Vande Mataram. Kismatun has sought a probe by a special investigation team into the death of her son, who, along with four other Muslim men, was seen in the video. The plea alleged that police had illegally detained her son and denied him critical healthcare, due to which he succumbed to the injuries on February 26, 2020. After examining the sealed report, the court said âit is neither here nor there and nothing substantial has been stated in it.â "
22,"NEW DELHI: A court has framed charges of rioting and arson against two persons in two separate cases of the northeast Delhi riots, saying if the material on record remained unrebutted during the trial, the conviction of the accused was reasonably possible. Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat, however, discharged Firoz and Mohd Anwar in two other cases, saying there was no evidence against the accused. The court framed charges against them in a case of alleged looting and setting ablaze shops in Dayalpur in February 2020. It noted that it was true that in his complaint, the complainant had not made any prayer for setting in motion the legal machinery to nab the culprits; but had he not wanted so, he would not have approached the police station and visited the office of the subdivisional magistrate concerned with the demand for compensation. The court said it was the mandatory duty of the officer-incharge of a police station to register the FIR on the basis of a complaint if the same disclosed the commission of a cognisable offence. âThe officer-incharge of the police station cannot refuse registration of the FIR merely for the reason that no such request has been made in the complaint. It is for him to examine the complaint in order to ascertain whether or not any cognisable offence has taken place and if so, to register the FIR,â the court observed. It further said the witness and constable Vikas, who was the beat officer on duty, clearly identified the accused persons as allegedly being part of the unlawful assembly. âI find sufficient prima facie evidence on record to frame charges against the accused and put them to trial,â the judge said. While discharging them in two other riot cases, the court said the witness, constable Ankit, had nowhere stated that he had seen the accused indulging in vandalisation and arson in the shops/houses of the complainants. âIt does not appear from the entire material on record that at the time of apprehending these two accused, there was any material with the IO showing their involvement in the riotous incidents,â it remarked. It further noted that none of the complainants had given the name or any identification mark of any alleged rioter. "
23,"NEW DELHI: A court in Delhi on Monday deferred the pronouncement of its order on the bail application of former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Umar Khalid in a case related to the alleged larger conspiracy behind Delhi riots. Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat of Karkardooma court will now pronounce the order next Monday (March 21). On March 3, the same bench had reserved its order on Khalid's bail plea after hearing the submissions of parties in the matter. Opposing the bail plea, Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) Amit Prasad argued on the relevance of the speech given by Umar Khalid in Amravati in February 2020. He said the bail application was rejected on February 11, pointing out that the announcement of Donald Trump visiting India came on the same day. During the course of the hearing, Khalid's counsel, opposing the charges under the Indian Penal Code and UAPA, termed the charge sheet a 'work of fiction'. He argued that the speech given by Khalid was about Gandhi, harmony, and the Constitution, and it is not a crime. After the submissions, the court had reserved the order. Khalid, one of the accused in the conspiracy case, has been booked under the anti-terror law -- Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). The riots broke out in northeast Delhi in February 2020 after clashes between anti-CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) and pro-CAA protesters took a violent turn. The mayhem, which coincided with then US President Donald Trump's maiden trip to India, saw over 50 people lose their lives and over 700 injured. "
24,"NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has discharged five accused people in a northeast Delhi riots case, saying it would be sheer wastage of judicial time if the charges are to be framed against them upon considerations of the evidence on the basis of which they have to be acquitted later on. The case pertains to vandalism and setting shops on fire at Sonia Vihar. Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat discharged Ajay, Rohit Saxena, Utkarsh, Raj and Harender Rawat of all the offences. âCharges cannot be framed against these accused upon taking into account the material annexed with the chargesheet on the basis of which there is no possibility of their conviction at the final stage,â the court said in an order on March 28. It noted that there was only one witness who is stated to have identified these accused as alleged assailants, but he had not identified them directly at the spot from the riotous mob. âHe (witness) is stated to have identified these accused as the rioters from the video footage shown to him by the IO (investigating officer) on 15.03.2020. There is no other witness who has identified, either directly or indirectly, these accused to be the assailants,â it added. The court, however, framed charges against Ashutosh, Vishwajeet and Hunny for the offences of rioting, arson and unlawful assembly. It said that they have been identified as alleged rioters by more than one witness. "
25,"NEW DELHI: Two years after Intelligence Bureau staffer Ankit Sharma lost his life in communal riots in northeast Delhi, the AAP government has given his younger brother a job in the state education department. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday handed over the appointment letter to Ankur Sharma, who has been posted as a junior assistant. In a series of tweets, Kejriwal accused BJP of doing âdirty politicsâ on the issue and leaving the Sharma family in a lurch. In a separate statement, AAPâs functionary and corporation in-charge Durgesh Pathak blamed BJP of âfuelling the riotsâ and asked it to âapologiseâ to the people of Delhi. BJP accused Kejriwal and Pathak of doing politics over the compensation package extended to the Sharma family and giving political patronage to AAPâs municipal councillor Tahir Hussain, who is one of the main accused in Ankitâs murder case. The AAP government had earlier provided financial aid of Rs 1 crore to Ankitâs family. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio, was also present when Kejriwal met Ankit, accompanied by his mother and sister, at his office. Sisodia encouraged Ankur to join work at the earliest. Ankitâs body was found near a drain in Chand Bagh on February 26, 2020, a day after he went missing. The postmortem report revealed 51 stab wounds on his body. In March 2021, the Delhi cabinet approved the proposal of offering a government job to Ankur. It was then sent to the lieutenant governor for approval. After handing over the appointment letter to Ankur, Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi: âWe can never compensate for the loss of a loved oneâs life, but I hope this government job and an assistance of Rs 1 crore bring the family strength. We will continue to stand by them and support them whenever needed.â âBJP did dirty politics on the death of Ankit Sharma and then left his family unattended. We didnât do any politics, kept in constant touch with the family and helped them at every stage,â he further tweeted. Pathak said the Kejriwal government fulfilled its promise of giving a government job to Ankur despite his brother being a central government employee. âBJP must explain why the Centre did not offer his family a job when Ankit worked for their agency,â he added. Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor, however, said it was the constitutional duty of the state government to extend relief packages to riot victims. âItâs really saddening that Delhi government and AAP are extending the relief package after a delay of two years,â he added. âIf Kejriwal and Pathak are really sensitive towards Ankitâs family, they should tell people why his murder accused Tahir Hussain has not been expelled from AAP,â said Kapoor. "
26,"NEW DELHI: In the first order convicting a man in a north-east Delhi riots case, a local court has said the circumstances in which members of the Muslim community were identified and beaten up by a mob and the fact that the accused, who was amongst the rioters, was armed are sufficient to indicate beyond any doubt he shared the common objective to assault Muslims and damage their properties. TOI reported in its Tuesday edition that the court on Monday convicted Dinesh Yadav (25) for being part of the mob that had set on fire a 73-year-old woman's house in Gokalpuri on February 25, 2020. The woman was not present in the house when the incident occurred. Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat said though the evidence on record did not indicate that Yadav had directly committed the offence, yet he was to be held guilty of all the offences committed by the members of unlawful assembly because he shared their common objective and knew that these offences were likely to be committed. While delivering the judgement, the court took note of ""the circumstances in which members of the Muslim community were identified and beaten, their vehicles damaged and their houses broken open, robbed and set ablaze by the rioters, comprising members of the other community"". It noted that the accused was armed with a wooden rod. These are ""sufficient to indicate beyond any doubt that he too shared the common object of the assembly and had knowledge that these types of incidents would be indulged in by the members of the assembly,"" the judge said in the order. The court noted that it was true that the testimony of the beat police officials and the two eyewitnesses to the incident revealed that Yadav had not taken an active part in vandalizing, looting or setting on fire the house of the complainant. However, it cannot be said that he was only a bystander or a passive spectator at the spot, said the court. TimesViewThe Delhi riots happened in February 2020. It is good that the first conviction has taken place. Hopefully more convictions will follow in the coming weeks. It is important that riot victims do not feel let down by the justice system.""The mere fact that he was not seen entering the complainant's house or vandalizing or looting or putting it on fire does not mean that he was a mere bystander,"" said the court. It added that the testimony of the beat police officials, on the other hand, clearly indicated that on February 25, 2020, Yadav was part of an unlawful assembly, consisting of 200-300 rioters who indulged in large-scale riots in Bhagirathi Vihar, Delhi. It observed that from the deposition of the prosecution witnesses, it was seen that the rioters belonged to the Hindu community whereas the victims were members of the Muslim community. "
27,"NEW DELHI: Advocacy against the law like the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is not a crime, former JNU student leader Umar Khalid told a Delhi court on Monday, asserting that the police pressured the witnesses to give statements in the riots conspiracy case. Senior advocate Trideep Pais, appearing for Khalid, also told the court that one of the protected witnesses had informed a police officer about the purported plans of the riots beforehand and asked why they took place if the police knew about it. The lawyer made the remarks during the hearing in a case related to the communal violence that had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24, 2020, after clashes between the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) supporters and its protesters spiralled out of control. Arguing for Khalid's bail before Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat, Pais read out the statements of four protected witnesses and claimed that they were ""written by the police and given to the witnesses to endorse."" In the last hearing, he had read the statements of two other witnesses and alleged that they were cooked up. Today, he referred to one of the police allegations regarding an alleged secret meeting in Delhi's Seelampur area on January 23 and 24, 2020, in which Khalid had allegedly directed that the protests be escalated to riots and result in the spilling of blood of policemen and others. ""For the Seelampur meeting, you [prosecution] have six witnesses. One witness absolutely has nothing on me. Another witness had nothing on me in the police statement but introduced a provocative speech in a statement before the magistrate,"" he told the court. The lawyer added, ""A third witness is a person who was miraculously in touch with the police since January and kept the SHO informed at every level but does nothing about it. One other witness is the only person who says there was a secret office and not a meeting. No witness calls it a secret meeting. These statements without any doubt are procured."" Pais told the court that a witness met the station house officer (SHO) in January 2020 and that the officer knew everything about the riots plan beforehand. ""He says that I was regularly in touch with SHO who asked me to keep him updated. So, Seelampur SHO knew everything. How did we have riots in the city? This brilliant intelligence he had about this and he did not register an FIR. If you are in touch with the SHO, then why did you not ensure that nothing went on?"" he asked. Besides this, the lawyer said that another witness did not speak of the alleged secret meeting in the statement given to the police, but seven days later, the witness ""miraculously"" mentioned it in a statement given before a magistrate. ""Obviously, the statement did not suit the police and they could not go back and change it so they ensured that the witness goes to the magistrate and say this. Remember one thing, advocacy against a law is not a crime,"" he said referring to the opposition to the CAA. To show more contradictions in the statement, the lawyer said that in one of the statements the witness claimed that co-accused Gulfisha asked women and children to carry chilly powder and acid to protest on Khalid's directions, but in another statement, they claimed that Gulfisha herself asked them to carry it. ""Why would you believe this witness? The witness has clearly been pressured to give statements,"" he asserted. The lawyer said even though the witness did not claim to be present in the meeting, it still gave granular details and claimed that JNU student Natasha Narwal was present there but her Call Data Record (CDR) showed otherwise. He further said that one other witness did not speak about the alleged secret meeting or Khalid in his statement to the police on April 16 but suddenly recalled that the accused gave a provocative speech in a statement before the magistrate on April 24. The lawyer said that the fourth witness did not speak about the meeting at all. Delhi Police have given imaginary names to the witnesses such as Echo, Delta, Gamma, and Yanky, Sierra, and Smith to protect their identity.  In the last hearing, Khalid told the court that statements of the witnesses in the case were written by someone else and given to them as police did not have any evidence. Umar Khalid and several others have been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), a stringent anti-terror law, and are accused of being the ""masterminds"" of the February 2020 riots in the national capital which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured. "
28,"NEW DELHI: A court has acquitted a man in a northeast Delhi riots case, saying none of the complainants/public witnesses identified the accused as a rioter or a member of any unlawful assembly. Additional sessions judge Virender Bhat said the deposition of two police witnesses would indicate that Rohit was only a bystander, and not among the rioters. âThe prosecution has failed to produce any evidence to substantiate the charges against the accused. Resultantly, the accused is acquitted of all the charges,â the court said on January 15. It noted that in the cross-examination, both witnesses had deposed the accused was standing 10 metres away from them in Gokalpuri during the riots in February 2020. On the basis of this, the special public prosecutor argued the accused had been seen among the rioters near Jannati Masjid and, therefore, was liable to be convicted under IPC 149, though no witness had seen him committing vandalisation, robbery, arson, etc, the judge pointed out, adding that âI do not find any force in the submissionsâ. The court observed, âNeitherâ¦ has deposed in the chief examination that they had identified any of the rioters, not to speak of accused Rohit.â "
29,"NEW DELHI: Former JNU student leader Umar Khalid on Thursday told a Delhi court that witness statements recorded by the police in the riots conspiracy case were ""fabricated"". Khalid and several others have been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), a stringent anti-terror law, and are accused of being the ""masterminds"" of the riots which had left 53 people dead and over 700 injured. Arguing his bail plea before Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat, senior advocate Trideep Pais, representing Khalid, said that the witness statements were ""inconsistent with each other, and will not stand the test of law."" He read out a statement of one of the witnesses and said, âEven a 12-year-old would know this is a fabrication. They (prosecution) should be ashamed. Not even a shred of physical evidence.â He added, âI recently watched a movie called 'The Trial of Chicago 7' where witnesses of the State had already planned to be the witnesses of the State.â The lawyer was addressing the allegation levelled by the police against Khalid that he and his father were present at a protest organized by the Welfare Party of India at Jantar Mantar, wherein children and women were taken in buses. âI am not even admitting to that but advocacy that persons should protest against CAA, how is that an offence?"" he said and concluded his arguments. He had begun his arguments on the bail plea on August 23. Special Public Prosecutor Amit Prasad will commence the arguments on the behalf of police on January 5, 2022. The Delhi Police had earlier said that the bail plea has no merit and that it will demonstrate the prima facie case against him before the court by referring to the charge sheet filed in the case. In the last hearing, Khalid, through his lawyer, said that advocacy against a law like the Citizenship Amendment Act CAA is not a crime and that the police pressured the witnesses to give statements.

30,"NEW DELHI: Escalating the crackdown on controversial Islamist outfit Popular Frontpfiof India (PFI), Delhi Policeâs Special Cell has arrested its Delhi unit president, Parvez Ahmed, and secretary, Mohammad Iliyas, for allegedly funding the riots and fanning violence during anti-CAA protests in the city. Earlier, police had arrested Danish Khan, a secretary of PFI. The arrested men â Ahmed and Iliyas â were already under investigation by the Enforcement Directorate which is studying PFIâs financial transactions as part of a probe into the role of the outfit in anti-CAA protests. The ED claims to have seized a tablet device from Parvez which purportedly has records of a chain of conversations about anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh and violence at JNU between him and a member of Parliament. The agencies have also established a suspicious pattern of deposits into and withdrawal of money from PFIâs accounts. Iliyas was first to be arrested from Jafrabad on Wednesday, while Parvez was picked up from Parliament Street in the evening where a protest against the arrest of Danish was planned. Sources said that the cops made Iliyas call up Parvez to the âprotest siteâ and arrested him upon arrival. The Special Cell claims to have clinching evidence about PFI spreading fake propaganda and fanning violence during the anti-CAA protests. Danish, who was arrested earlier, handled the outfitâs intelligence wing and was spotted at all major protests in the city. âHis interrogation has given clues regarding the outfitâs âinformation war,ââ an officer said. The FIR, in the case was filed by the Crime Branch, but since the larger conspiracy regarding the Delhi riots is being probed by the Special Cell, the matter has been transferred to them, said a senior official. PFI has, however, called the move a conspiracy against it. âWhatever happens in India, the agencies put their blame on us. Never in the past have such allegations been proved. Even this time, we will come out clean,â the outfit stated. Watch Delhi: PFI President, Secretary arrested by special cell"
31,"New Delhi: A Delhi court on Wednesday dismissed the bail pleas of activists Gulfisha Fatima and Tasleem Ahmed, arrested under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in connection with the northeast Delhi riots, saying the allegations against them were prima facie true. Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat said that a look at the statements of the protected witnesses shows sufficient incriminating material against them. Special public prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for the police, had submitted that Fatima and Ahmed were allegedly part of a pre-meditated conspiracy in the riots. He had further alleged that they were regularly in touch with the main conspirators. The public prosecutor had also argued that the sit-in protest sites were carefully planned, picking strategic sites closer to 25 mosques. He said that the protest sites were purposely given secular names to give legitimate appearance to the allegedly communal protests. He had argued that it was a âconspiracy of silenceâ and conspirators allegedly communicated through WhatsApp groups to pre-plan the riots. Advocate Mehmood Pracha, appearing for Fatima, had argued that she was peacefully protesting at the sites which is not a crime. He had submitted that she had been falsely implicated in the matter. Former Congress councillor Ishrat Jahan was granted bail in the case on Monday. The court had said that even if it is accepted that she had connectivity with the other accused persons, yet the fact remains that she was neither physically present in northeast Delhi for riots nor was she part of any group, organisation or WhatsApp groups or her name cropped up in flurry of calls or in any CCTV footage or in any of the conspiratorial meetings. âThe entire conspiracy as spelt out in the chargesheet, as far as it ascribes the role of accused Ishrat Jahan, who is a woman, for the limited purpose of bail application on a prima facie considerations, persuades this court to allow the application for bail despite the embargoes in CrPC and UAPA,â it had said. Co-accused Jamia student Asif Iqbal Tanha and JNU students Natasha Narwal and Devangana Kalita were granted bail in the case by Delhi High Court last year. Accused Safoora Zargar was granted bail by a city court in 2020 on humanitarian grounds as she was pregnant. "
32,"New Delhi: The president of Alumni Association of Jamia Milia Islamia (AAJMI) Shifa-Ur Rehman alleged before a court on Monday that there had been systemic violation of his fundamental rights by the prosecution in a northeast Delhi riot case. His counsel claimed that the sanction for prosecution granted in the case was not fair and honest as the material of the investigation was reviewed by an independent authority before the probe was completed. âThere are discrepancies regarding Rehmanâs arrest too. His arrest memo shows that he was arrested from Uttar Pradesh. But in the chargesheet, it shows that he was arrested by the ACP concerned in Delhi,â Rehmanâs counsel told additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat during the hearing of his bail plea. âAlso, he was called to the police station and then arrested. He was willing to cooperate,â he said. The counsel added that during the initial days of custody, Rehman was not allowed to interact with his lawyer. âAAJMI has 10 office bearers. None other than him has been arraigned as an accused. He was also part of Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC)... Being a part of AAJMI or JCC is not sufficient to make a person part of a conspiracy. He was neither the administrator nor did he send a single message that instigated violence.â He argued that the independent review committee last reviewed the material of the investigation as per Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act on August 4, 2020, after which over 400 witnesses were examined by police. âEvery so-called evidence against me has been collected after this date. If the exercise of gathering evidence was not complete, no independent review should have been doneâ¦â The charges have not been framed and the trial will take a long time, and hence, he deserves to be granted bail, the lawyer said. Special public prosecutor Amit Prasad, appearing for police, opposed the bail plea, saying Rehman was arrested by the ACP concerned as required under UAPA. âThe requirement is not that once sanction has been obtained, beyond that date if material comes during further investigation, it cannot be relied upon by the prosecution,â he submitted. "
33,"NEW DELHI: The official death toll in northeast Delhiâs riots rose to 42 on Friday with four more people dying at Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital. The Jumma prayers, meanwhile, passed off peacefully. Policemen and paramilitary forces kept a close watch, with drones deployed above, during the 10 hours of section 144 being relaxed. The police are, however, still looking for AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, booked in the murder case of IB official Ankit Sharma. His mobile phone has been switched off and a man who was coordinating with the media on his behalf claimed he has not been in touch with him as well. On Friday, a forensic team, along with members of SIT, inspected the drain from where Sharmaâs body had been recovered. The police suspect that Sharma was first killed and then his body dumped in the drain. GTBâs medical director Dr Sunil Kumar told TOI they had recorded 38 deaths since Monday. Of these, 16 people have been identified and 12 are unknown. Seven had gunshot injuries, eight had blunt assault wounds, three had been stabbed, five had suffered burns, one had been stabbed and shot while the cause in four cases was unknown. He added that about 50 injured people were still in the hospital. Lok Nayak Hospital has recorded three deaths and another death has been reported from Jag Pravesh Chandra Hospital in east Delhiâs Shahdara. Dr Kishore Singh, medical director of Lok Nayak Hospital, said 56 injured people had been brought there in the past four days. One of them was brought dead while two died during treatment. Eleven people are still in hospital, he said. âOn Monday, when the riots began and patients started pouring in with serious injuries, there was some chaos. But within a day, a system was put in place for smooth triaging â deciding the order of treatment â depending on seriousness of the injuries and to manage the manpower needs. Some of the staffers who were on leave were asked to join immediately,â said a senior nursing staff at GTB Hospital. This hospital, with 2,500 beds, is the largest in east Delhi. Due to its proximity to the areas where maximum violence took place, most of the injured were rushed to the hospital beginning Monday. A senior official in the state health department said Wednesday onwards, when GTB Hospitalâs emergency wing was running to near-full capacity, some of the patients with minor injuries were referred to Jag Pravesh Chandra and other hospitals. âNow, the government has also clarified that it will bear the cost of treatment for those injured in the riots even if they are being treated at private facilities,â he pointed out. "
34,"NEW DELHI: Delhi Police on Saturday denied media reports that it had named CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury, Swaraj Abhiyan leader Yogendra Yadav, economist Jayati Ghosh, Delhi University professor and activist Apoorvanand and documentary filmmaker Rahul Roy as co-conspirators in a supplementary chargesheet filed in the north-east Delhi riots case, even as a political row erupted over the issue. Yechury slammed Delhi Police, saying that its âillegitimate, illegal actionsâ were a âdirect outcomeâ of the politics done by the BJPâs top leadership. Referring to a PTI tweet on the subject, a Delhi Police spokesperson said, âIn a case related to Jafrabad riotsâ¦it has been mentioned in one of the online news agency reports that the names are part of the disclosure statement of one of the accused in connection with organising and addressing the anti-CAA protests."" ""The disclosure statement has been truthfully recorded as narrated by the accused person,â added the statement. âHowever, a person is not arraigned as an accused only on the basis of a disclosure statement. It is only on the existence of sufficient corroborative evidence that further legal action is taken. The matter is currently sub judice."" Yadav was quick to call the report âfactually incorrectâ. He clarified that his name, and that of Yechury, were mentioned only in passing. âSupplementary chargesheet does NOT mention me as co-conspirator, or even as accused. One passing reference to me and Yechury, in an unauthenticated police statement (not admissible in court) by one accused,â he tweeted. However, he later alleged in another tweet that Delhi Police was indeed trying âvery hardâ to drag all anti-CAA protesters into the circle of conspirators. âMy only clarification is that as yet Delhi Police has not formally named me or Yechury as conspirators or accused,â he tweeted. Disclosure statements or confessions are recorded by the police under Section 161 of CrPC during investigation. However, they are not admissible as evidence in a court of law. Naming a person in a chargesheet as an accused is different from his name figuring in an accused's confession. The persons whose disclosure statements have been quoted were arrested a few months ago and their statements recorded at that time. However, till now, Yechuri, Yadav or Ghosh haven't been questioned. The police had questioned Professor Apoorvanand but not on the basis of a disclosure statement. They had claimed to have done so after getting electronic evidence, including chats and other technical evidence against him. The PTI report referred to the alleged confessions of three students -- Pinjra Tod members and JNU students Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal, and Gulfisha Fathima of Jamia Milia Islamia -- in the Jafrabad violence case. All three are facing charges under various sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the report said. The report said that Delhi Police has claimed that Kalita and Narwal admitted to not just their complicity in the riots but also named Ghosh, Apoorvanand and Roy as their mentors, who allegedly asked them to carry out the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and go to âany extremeâ. They also told the police, according to the agency report, that the three coordinated with the Islamist group Popular Front of India (PFI) and Jamia Coordination Committee to mentor the Pinjra Tod members for carrying forward their campaign against CAA. The PTI report said the police had used Jamia student Fathima's statement to corroborate the ensuing events. In her statement, Fathima said that she was told to organise the protest to âmalign the image of the Government of Indiaâ, the police claimed. In her statement, she said that âbig leaders and lawyers started coming in to provoke and mobilize this crowd, including Umar Khalid, Chandrashekhar Ravan, Yogendar Yadav, Sitaram Yechury, and lawyer Mahmood Pracha, etcâ. While Yadav was circumspect in dealing with the allegation, Yechury alleged the BJP was âscaredâ of legitimate and peaceful protests by mainstream political parties and was, as a result, âmisusing state powerâ to target the opposition. âBJP's illegal intimidation won't stop people from opposing discriminatory laws like CAA. To assert that all Indians are equal irrespective of their religion, caste, colour, creed, region, gender and political affiliations is not only our right but our duty. We will exercise it,â he said. âThe BJP govt is scared of questions, in Parliament, in media & RTI. PM can't hold a press conference or answer RTIs about his private fund or show his degree. They think they can silence political opposition by blatant misuse of state power. We fought Emergency, weâll defeat this too,â he tweeted. Referring to the development as an assault on democracy and reflective of BJPâs true âchaal, charitra, chehraâ, Yechury said that hate speech videos by those who instigated violence and which left 56 people dead in Delhi are on record. âThe person who led violent mobs in JNU is also on video. The BJP govt and Delhi Police under it canât see those because it (sic) is hell-bent upon destroying our democracy,â he tweeted. Supreme Court advocate Prashant Bhushan said the Delhi Police action âprovedâ the âmala fide nature of Delhi police investigationsâ into the riots. âNothing could be more absurd than to accuse Sitaram Yechury, Yogendra Yadav, Jayati Ghosh and Prof Apoorvanand of instigating riots. Their speeches are available on video. This while Kapil Mishra & Co are let off,â he tweeted. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor tweeted, âStunned to see this. While those who actually incited & perpetrated violence are allowed to go scot free? What is happening to our country?â Meanwhile, Lok Sabha MP and former president of the Delhi BJP, Manoj Tiwari, said that several opposition leaders had made divisive remarks during the Delhi riots, which created suspicion about their role in inciting violence. âIf police have named any particular leader, it must have been done after a thorough and impartial probe,â he said, adding that the law will take its course. He said there are several instances of a few leaders making remarks which had potential to cause communal strife. âLet police do its work.â Watch Sitaram Yechury and Yogendra Yadav not charged in Delhi riots, clarify cops"

36,"NEW DELHI: Delhi High Court has sought the response of the AAP government on a plea by son of a 1984 anti-Sikh riots murder victim claiming he has not been rehabilitated or given a job, despite policies announced in 2006 and 2014. Justice Yashwant Varma gave four weeks time to the Delhi government to file a reply, after it found that the state government had not filed any response to the plea filed last year. It was hearing a plea by one Pankaj Bakshi who lost his father in the 1984 riots and urged the court to ensure that the Delhi government implements the courtâs earlier order of 2019. The court noted that ârehabilitative measures, which were liable to be taken in terms of the circulars of 16 January, 2006 and which would include the providing of employment opportunities is an issue that has to be considered by the Delhi government.â It pointed out that although notice was issued to the Delhi government, no affidavit on their behalf has been filed. Appearing for the petitioner, advocate Gagan Gandhi informed the court that in 2019, the high court had directed the lieutenant governor and the Delhi government to provide employment to children or family members of those killed in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. It had said the government must rehabilitate the kin after verification of applicants and on the basis of Centreâs 2006 circular. The Centreâs 2006 circular had directed that the children or other family members of those killed in these riots be provided jobs on compassionate grounds. However in the PIL filed by the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) on which the 2019 verdict came, it was highlighted that despite the 2006 circular, it has been over 12 years and the Delhi government failed to give jobs to even a single applicant. "
37,"NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday vowed to ensure punishment for those responsible for the Delhi riots irrespective of their religion, caste and political affiliation, asserting that action against the culprits would go down as an example for future rioters across the country. âI convey my condolences to all those who have lost their family members. I promise that none of the guilty will be spared no matter which religion, caste or political party they belong to. Delhi Police will act with such firmness that these riots will become a case study of the consequences that should visit those engage in riots,â Shah told Lok Sabha after an over five-hour debate on communal violence in the Capital. Home minister Amit Shah said the government wants to set up a claims commission to recover damages from rioters, and the Delhi high court has already been approached for the purpose. âAbout 700 FIRs have been filed, 152 weapons used in violence seized and 49 cases lodged under the Arms Act. Also, 2,647 people have been detained or arrested so far,â Shah said. Congress walked out of the House during the reply, provoking a sharp response from the usually quiet highways minister Nitin Gadkari. Responding to attacks from Congress which demanded his resignation and others in the opposition, Shah strongly rebutted the charges of failure and police inaction, saying the communal violence that claimed 53 lives was a pre-planned, well-organised conspiracy executed with hawala funds. âThe spread of riots on such a big scale in such a short time is not possible without a conspiracy. We have registered a case of conspiracy to probe this angle. Three people have been arrested for financing the violence in northeast Delhi,â he said. A combative Shah marshalled details to refute that Delhi police, which works under the home ministry, had failed, saying that riots had been controlled within 36 hours and were not allowed to spread beyond 12 police stations. âThe first complaint of riot was reported at 2 pm on February 24. It goes to the credit of the force that not a single incident of rioting took place after 11 pm on February 25,â he said. Shah said it was an achievement considering that northeast district had the highest population density in the country, was marked by a maze of narrow lanes and had a historically high crime rate. âIt borders UP from where 300 criminals were brought in as part of a sinister conspiracy to organise violence during the visit of US President Donald Trump,â he added. The minister focused on the role of social media in what has been dubbed the first âdigitised riotsâ. âMore than 60 social media accounts were created specifically to incite communal violence between February 22 and 26,â he added. Shah said many of the social media accounts were since shut but police were looking for those responsible. âIf they feel that they will get away, they are mistaken, law will take its course,â he said, adding that 25 cases under the IT Act had been registered. He responded to the charge that the Union government failure to take action against BJP members who made âprovocative speechesâ by referring to speeches of AIMIMâs Waris Pathan and others to say that inflammatory comments defined anti-CAA protests. He also mentioned the âaar-paar ki ladaiâ comment Sonia Gandhi had made at Ramlila Maidan, although he did not name the Congress chief. The minister stressed that riots were not a spontaneous outbreak. Responding to the allegation that the Centre delayed debate in Parliament, he said the government wanted the riots to be discussed after Holi to avoid communal flare-up during festival time. âThere has been a history of communal clashes during Holi. It seems others had other priorities,â he said. He refused the demand for a community-wise break-up of fatalities and said, âI wonât give figures in âHindu-Muslimâ as has been demanded by some members. 53 Indians have died, 526 Indians have been injured. Shops of 371 Indians were set ablaze and houses of 142 Indians were burned.â Shah also denied that he was missing in action. âI was in Ahmedabad on February 24 because the public reception for the visiting US President had been organised in my constituency. I came back the same evening and stayed away from Trumpâs reception at Rashtrapati Bhavan, and the banquet organised for him to concentrate on the deployment of security forces,â he said.

38,"NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has dismissed an 80-year-old manâs plea seeking a declaration of his sonâs death, allegedly killed during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, saying he has produced no document to prove that his son even existed. The court said it is a matter of common and legal sense that only a person known to have existed in the first place can be declared dead. The man had approached the court seeking declaration of civil death of his son Ajit Singh and procuring/issuance of a death certificate from the office of the concerned registrar of births and deaths. âNeedless to say, before seeking a declaration that a person is dead, plaintiff had the onus to prove the existence of Ajit Singh, who is the âpersonâ sought to be declared dead. On the contrary, despite a query by the court during final arguments, the plaintiff did not bring on record any ID proof of Ajit Singh nor any document which could reasonably satisfy the court about his identity and existence,â Civil Judge Helly Fur Kaur said in an order on Thursday. The court noted that it was an admitted fact that no missing report was available with the man since the police allegedly refused to register the same. The one lodged with Delhi administration was misplaced. According to the suit filed by the man, his son allegedly went missing during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots and his efforts to trace him failed. He submitted that it is trite law that a person who has not been heard of for seven years by those who would naturally have heard of if he had been alive should be presumed dead. The suit said it was incumbent to submit here that the plaintiffâs son had not been heard by anyone among the family/relatives/ friends since the riots, so his son was presumed and declared dead. It further said that in any event, for issuance of a death certificate and for seeking compensation, the plaintiff needs to obtain a declaration of civil death of his son. "

42,"NEW DELHI: A Delhi court said it was âquite painedâ by the âcallous attitudeâ of police on a complaint related to the alleged burning and desecration of a mosque during the northeast Delhi riots in February last year. The complaint filed by Haji Hashim Ali alleged that on February 25, 2020, a mob of 20-25 people, armed with sticks, rods, petrol bombs and acid, broke into Madina Masjid at Shiv Vihar and destroyed everything they could lay their hands on. Police clubbed Aliâs complaint with another FIR (no. 72/ 2020) registered on the complaint of one Naresh Chand regarding the burning of his house, in which Ali was named as an accused, thus making Ali also a complainant. Court: Strange that complainant in riot case an accused tooAli was arrested in the case but subsequently got bail. Following this, he approached the magistrate court seeking registration of a separate FIR, which was allowed when police told the court that FIR 72/2020 had Aliâs complaint too. Police challenged this before the sessions court and informed that they had already filed an FIR (no. 55/ 2020) in the Madina Masjid arson case before Ali had approached the court. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav said police were not even aware that an FIR had already been registered at Karawal Nagar police station when Ali approached the magistrate court. ""This prima facie reflects the callous attitude/negligence on the part of the investigating agency, as it was incumbent upon it to have placed complete material before the learned additional chief metropolitan magistrate (North East). This court is quite pained to see the lackadaisical attitude adopted by the investigating agency in the matter,"" added the order. Noting that the magistrate court had not committed any flaw as its order to file an FIR on Aliâs complaint was based on insufficient material, the sessions court remanded back the case to it to consider the matter afresh. The sessions court also noted that it was ""really strange"" that Ali was not only the complainant in FIR 72/2020, but also an accused, which was an ""apparent absurdity"". Advocate M R Shamshad, appearing for Ali, claimed that various wrong status reports were submitted before the court and police had disclosed the second FIR (55/ 2020) exactly a year later. "
43,"NEW DELHI: BJP leader Kapil Mishra made an appearance before the special cell of Delhi Police in Lodhi Colony on Thursday afternoon. After he came out Mishra said that he only came to file a complaint against people who according to him are running a campaign against him in the northeast Delhi riots case. ""When the Delhi Police is filing charge sheets, when the rioters are being arrested at this time there is a section which is running a hate campaign against me and trying to save the real conspirators and that is why I came to the Special Cell office to file a complaint so that these people could be investigated,"" Mishra said. Asked if the police also questioned him regarding his role in the northeast Delhi riots, he said that the police has already questioned him and these details are already in the charge sheets. BJP leader Mishra was questioned in the last week of July by the Delhi Police Special Cell in connection with the northeast Delhi riots, where he claimed that he had gone to the area to ""resolve the situation"", that he gave ""no speech"", and that remarks made by him standing next to a DCP were only meant to convey his intention of launching a 'dharna' to counter anti-CAA protesters. These details find a mention in a charge sheet filed by the Delhi Police before Delhi's Karkardooma court last week. In a video tweeted by him on February 23 - a day before riots broke out in northeast Delhi - Mishra can be seen addressing a pro-CAA gathering near the Maujpur traffic signal and standing next to DCP (North East) Ved Prakash Surya. He can be seen saying, ""They (protesters) want to create trouble in Delhi. That's why they have closed the roads. That is why they have created a riot-like situation here. We have not pelted stones. The DCP is standing in front of us and on your behalf, I want to tell him that till the US President (Donald Trump) is in India, we are leaving the area peacefully. After that, we won't listen to you (police) if the roads are not vacated by then. We will have to take to the streets."" Violence broke out in northeast Delhi on February 24 between CAA supporters and protesters and spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured. "
44,"NEW DELHI: A Delhi court Monday extended by three days the ED custody of suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain in a money laundering case related to the communal violence in northeast Delhi in February. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) was probing the allegation that Hussain and his linked persons laundered about Rs 1.10 crore funds, by using purported shell or dummy companies, to fuel the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the riots. Additional Sessions Judge Amitabh Rawat allowed the ED's application for Hussain's custodial interrogation considering the period of interrogation already done. The ED had sought Hussain's custody for nine days, saying as he was still needed to be confronted with other voluminous record and substantial number of persons were yet to be confronted with him. ""Considering the period of interrogation already done and as per the record, the further police custody remand of the accused Tahir Hussain is given for another period of three days from today. The Jail Superintendent shall immediately hand over the custody of the accused to the concerned investigating officer of the ED. The accused shall be handed over to the Jail authorities by September 10,"" the court said in its order. It directed officials to medically examine Hussain every 24 hours. It permitted Hussain's counsel to confer with him for a period not exceeding half an hour at the beginning of the ED custody. ""The concerned officials shall ensure that they remain outside the audible range during the period. Needless to state that the accused and his counsel shall follow the necessary distancing protocols in view of the outbreak of Covid-19,"" the court said. During the hearing, Senior advocate K K Manan and advocate Uditi Bali, appearing for Hussain, opposed the application saying the 15 days period for grant of ED custody has to begin from the date of arrest, August 20, and thus, further extension of remand was not permissible in law. Central Government Standing Counsel Amit Mahajan, appearing for ED, said the 15 days remand has to begin when his application was considered and allowed. Mahajan argued that the probe agency had obtained Hussain's physical custody on August 31 after the Jail authorities handed him over to the probe agency after performing the Covid-19 test. ED's Special Public Prosecutors N K Matta said further custody of Hussain was required as he was still needed to be confronted with other voluminous record and substantial number of persons were yet to be confronted with him. Complete and comprehensive investigation could not be completed within the custody remand granted by the court earlier, Matta said. ED had earlier told the court that Hussain was allegedly involved in money laundering and various other fraudulent acts of cheating, falsification and forgery of documents, and criminal conspiracy. Matta had said the ED has seized several incriminating documents and digital devices after conducting searches at various premises. ""Statements of several persons have been recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and WhatsApp chats, bogus invoices and other incriminating documents have been recovered,"" the public prosecutor had said. ED further alleged that Hussain had entered into a criminal conspiracy by fraudulently transferring money from the accounts of many companies. The money so obtained are allegedly proceeds of crime which were then used for committing various other scheduled offences, the agency had claimed. Manan had claimed that Hussain was a victim of circumstances and was not required for custodial interrogation as he faced the threat of torture. Hussain was arrested in connection with the riots in northeast Delhi in February. He has also been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in a conspiracy case related to the riots. He was also arrested in connection with the alleged murder of IB official Ankit Sharma during the riots. Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24 after violence between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured. "
45,"NEW DELHI: Three more bodies were recovered from a drain in northeast Delhi on Sunday. Hospital authorities, however, said that they had not received any bodies. Dr Sunil Kumar, medical director of GTB Hospital, claimed there were no new deaths. “The toll at GTB stands at 38,” he said. The total number of deaths stand at 42. Two bodies were pulled out from the drain that runs through Bhagirathi Vihar in Gokulpuri and another from a drain in Shiv Vihar. “None of the three bodies has been identified. Whether they are of riot victims or not can only be ascertained after postmortem,” a cop said. Delhi Police said no call was received in the control room regarding rioting in the last four days. “A total of 254 cases have been registered; 41 of them are under Arms Act. Over 900 people have been detained. The situation under control,” Mandeep Randhawa, PRO, Delhi Police, said. On Sunday evening, their were reports of a man being beaten up by a group of people in the inner lanes of Bhajanpura. While the victim, Basant Jha, has not filed a complaint with Delhi Police as he is a resident of Ghaziabad, his brother told TOI that he had received injuries and his car was damaged. Jha who was travelling from Bawana to Ghaziabad was allegedly stopped by a group and beaten up with an iron rod. “The incident took place between 4 pm and 5pm. My brother works in the hardware sector and had gone to Bawana buy some material. When he was returning, some of the main roads leading towards Ghaziabad were barricaded. He was forced to take the internal roads, as suggested by the internet navigation system,” he said. “Somewhere near Begumpur in Bhajanpura, a group of men stopped his car. Initially, Basant refused to come out, but when they started damaging his car, he had to. They also checked his identity,” he claimed. Situation in most parts of northeast Delhi, however, remained peaceful with police as well as paramilitary officers deployed in large numbers. Meanwhile, the SIT team is focusing on murder cases first. Once investigation of these cases is streamlined, the probe will move on to other violent and assault cases, an officer said. Cops have also been carrying out raids in search of suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, who has been booked in the murder case of Ankit Sharma, an IB official whose body was fished out from a drain. Police sources revealed that Tahir switched off his phone on February 27 at 10pm. His last location was near Dayalpur. The mobile number of a man who was coordinating with the media on behalf of Tahir was also switched off, they added. "
46,"NEW DELHI: Ignoring the Centreâs strong protest against Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarifâs comments on the Delhi riots, Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Khamenei on Thursday slammed India on the violence. Using the hashtag #IndianMuslimsInDanger, the Ayatollah tweeted, âThe hearts of Muslims all over the world are grieving over the massacre of Muslims in India. The government of India should confront extremist Hindus and their parties and stop the massacre of Muslims in order to prevent Indiaâs isolation from the world of Islam.â The hearts of Muslims all over the world are grieving over the massacre of Muslims in India.

On Tuesday, the MEA issued a demarche to the Turkish ambassador to protest against comments by Turkish President Recep Erdogan. âThey are factually inaccurate and driven by political agenda. We donât expect such irresponsible statements,â the MEA said. âUK has CAA concerns, but discussing them with IndiaâIn a speech in Ankara, Erdogan had said, âIndia right now has become a country where massacres are widespread. What massacres? Massacres of Muslims. By who? Hindus. How will these people make global peace possible? It is impossible. When making speeches â since they have a large population â they say, âwe are strongâ but that is not strength.â Freedom House, a US think tank, also flagged concerns about India. âThe Indian government has taken its Hindu nationalist agenda to a new level with a succession of policies... threatening the democratic future of a country long seen as a potential bulwark of freedom in Asia and the world,â it said. Nigel Adams, junior foreign minister of UK, told the House of Commons, âThe UK government has concerns about the potential impact of the legislation (CAA). It is because of our close ties with India that we are able to discuss difficult issues with them and make clear our concerns where we have them, including on the rights of minorities. We will continue to follow events and to raise our concerns when we have with them,â the minister said. The MEA has not reacted to this remark yet. "
47,"NEW DELHI: AAP councillor Tahir Hussain on Thursday denied that he was involved in the riots or in the killing of an Intelligence Bureau (IB) staffer whose family accused him of being behind the murder. Ankit Sharma (26), who worked for the IB, had gone missing on Tuesday and his body was found in a drain near his home in northeast Delhi's riot-hit Chand Bagh area on Wednesday. His family members claimed that the local councillor and his associates were behind the killing. Hussain rejected the allegations. ""I came to know from news reports that I am being blamed for the murder of a man. These are lies and baseless accusations. For our safety, my family and I had moved away from our home on Monday in police presence,"" he said. Hussain further said there should be an impartial probe into the incident and action should be taken against the guilty. ""It is wrong to target me. I and my family have nothing to do with it,"" he said.

48,"BATHINDA: Hundreds of activists of 14 unions of farmers, farm labourers, youth and students held protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR) in Bathinda on Wednesday. They said PM Narendra Modi-led Union government and Delhi Police were mute spectators to mobs attacking persons from the minority community, which resulted in killing of at least 22 people on both sides by Wednesday. The protesters claimed that happenings in Delhi were no less than the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. The protesters demanded registration of cases against perpetrators of crimes and compensation of Rs 10 lakh to families of all deceased. On a call given by these organisations, effigies of the Union government were burnt at 46 places in 15 districts of Punjab. Many protesters held pictures of martyr Bhagat Singh and said freedom fighters would have never dreamt that such senseless sectarian violence would happen in India and even religious places of a particular community would be targeted by vandals. Farm labour organisation Punjab Khet Mazdoor Union state general secretary Lachhman Singh Sewewala said the happenings in Delhi were âvery disturbingâ. âAgain, the same is being practised and members of minority community are being targeted. This will dent the secular image of India,â he said. Farmer organisation BKU (Ekta Dakaunda) president Buta Singh Burjgill and general secretary Jagmohan Singh said they were with Muslims of Delhi who had been made to face harrowing times. âWe will never tolerate such attacks on minority communities. Our protests will continue on Thursday,â Buta said. "
49,"NEW DELHI: The special investigating team probing the violence that occurred during the anti-CAA protests has found that at least 15 criminals, who are Bangladeshis, were involved in the clashes that took place in Seemapuri on December 20. Sources said all of them were staying illegally in JJ colonies on the cityâs borders. The Bangladeshis were earlier arrested for carrying out burglaries. Police sources said they have been identified and will be arrested soon. The SIT will now be probing who funded the protests as it suspects a foreign hand in it. The team will also visit Tihar Jail to interrogate the arrested rioters. During the Seemapuri riots, a group protesting at the Delhi-Ghaziabad border suddenly turned violent and started pelting stones at parked vehicles. When police tried to intervene, the mob chased after the handful of cops and threw stones and broken bottles at them. The SIT is probing whether there was a common link between all the riots. They are also trying to find out the source from which such huge gatherings at Seelampur and Daryaganj were mobilised. Some of the WhatsApp groups through which the youths were mobilised are being scanned to identify who motivated them. It has been found that the riots were spearheaded by a handful of people. Efforts are on to establish whether they were the same set of people involved in sparking all instances of violence at Seelampur, Seemapuri and Daryaganj. The analysis of the rumours circulated to fan the riots indicated at a well thought out strategy of someone who had been watching the developments from a distance. Police were shocked to find rioters already carrying stones and Molotov cocktails when they had reached the spot. "
50,"GURUGRAM: About 100 km from the seat of the Delhi riots, Mewat's 'Shaheen Bagh' is feeling the heat.  ""Things have changed since Delhi was allowed to burn,"" said Salamuddin, a lawyer and president of the Mewat Vikas Sabha.  The peaceful protest at Badkali Chowk against CAA, NRC and NPR began exactly a month ago, on the death anniversary of Gandhi. All of Mewat has been under Section 144 for about two months now, but the protest continues. The makeshift tent has been put together by locals just a little ahead of Badkali Chowk, sectioned into halves for women and men. It started with a handful of people holding readings of the Constitution, poetry and ghazals. By now, about 1,500 attend the protest every day. While the stir expanded by the day, police had not tried to clear the protest site - some cops said everything had been peaceful and they saw no reason to take action - until now. ""As pressure builds up elsewhere, the administration here has also been growing apprehensive. They have been asking us to end the protest. But we are determined to press on,"" Salamuddin said.  The middle ground they have reached is this - no speaker from outside will be invited for a week or so, and all speeches will be screened. ""No matter what happens in Delhi, we will not allow that to spill over here. There is no space for hatred,"" said Mohammed Sabir Qasmi, president of Jamiat Ulama e Hind's Gurugram unit. Atif, a young protester, said many in his family live in areas that were torched during the riots in north-east Delhi. ""Some of them fled from Hauz Rani and Shiv Vihar. They have been forced to abandon everything they have known, their houses and mosques razed to the ground - but they don't blame anyone. They have been asking us not to fall for hate speech,"" he added. Closer home, a fringe outfit, Hindu Sena, has unleashed an inflammatory campaign in Gurugram. But protesters are determined to keep that rhetoric out of the demonstration space here. ""We want action against politicians who incite violence and force minorities to flee their homes. But we don't want our people here to get instigated. We will go by what Gandhi and Ambedkar said and keep peace. We read their works here every day,"" said Atif. Every day, around 10am, the spot comes alive with the national anthem played on speakers. By noon, people from areas nearby flock to the protest, national flags and posters of Gandhi and Ambedkar in hand. They read the paper, perform skits and debate the political nuances of the law they are opposing. The day ends, again, with the national anthem. ""We want harmony. The point of our protest is to preserve that. We are not against anyone, nor is anyone against us,"" said Qasmi.  In keeping with the spirit of the protests that inspired them, it's women at the forefront of the Badkali Chowk protest too. ""Women have been leading our protest. Some who never spoke a word in the presence of men are addressing large gatherings. Young girls recite nazms, relate their experiences and give speeches,"" said Salamuddin.  And what do they speak of? ""Our girls talk about the schools they never got, the safety they never had and the fears they always live with. They find it liberating,"" said a 65-year-old woman. "
51,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi police on Friday filed its first chargesheet in a court in connection with recent riots in northeast Delhi accusing Shahrukh Pathan, arrested in a case related to Jaffarabad area, of trying to kill head-constable Deepak Dahiya and others by firing at them on February 24.

Pathan, 23, whose picture showing him pointing a gun at unarmed Delhi Police head constable Deepak Dahiya during the communal riots went viral on social media, was arrested from Uttar Pradesh's Shamli district. After opening fire, he kept the pistol at home and fled from the city in a car, police said. In the viral video, Pathan, a resident of northeast Delhi's Ghonda, could be seen pointing his pistol at the policeman on the Jaffrabad-Maujpur road on February 24. Police said after seeing himself on news channels following the incident, Pathan changed his clothes and fled to Punjab. He then moved to Bareilly in UP before hiding at a friend's house in Shamli in the state. The good quality semi-automatic pistol used by Pathan was bought from Munger in Bihar, according to police. A college dropout, Pathan was interested in body building and modelling. He used to make TikTok videos. He owns a shop and a socks manufacturing factory in Ghonda. The case was lodged under various provisions of the IPC including section 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), section 353 (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and section 307 (attempt to murder), sections 147 and 148 (both related to rioting). Provisons of the Arms Act were also invoked. "
52,"MEERUT: Of the 42 dead in northeast Delhi , at least seven are from adjoining west UP districts and the number is likely to soar as those killed in the riots are still being identified. Mostly in their 20s, those who fell prey to the mobs were daily wage labourers who had come to the national capital looking for better prospects. According to police, three of the dead were from Bulandshahr and two each from Hapur and Muzaffarnagar. Slain IB sleuth Ankit Sharma was also from Muzaffarnagar. He was cremated on Thursday in his native Itawa village, with full state honours. While some families are still waiting for the bodies to arrive-- with graves dug and the shrouds purchased. Till Friday afternoon, the family members of Ashfaq Hussain (22) were waiting for his body to arrive in Bulandshahr village. An electrician who got married just 10 days ago, Ashfaq was going to attend a job complaint when he was shot, five times. His wife of 10 days has not slept for the last four days, and wants a glimpse of her husband, one last time. Parvez Ahmad, a 50-year-old social activist from Muzaffarnagar, was shot dead when he went out to pacify people of two communities rioting on northeast Delhi street. While in Hapur Dehat, the news of Mohsinâs âpresumed deathâ was broke to his family on Friday morning. Mohsinâs charred car was recovered during the violence. Hapurâs additional superintendent of police (ASP) Sarvesh Mishra said, âIt is presumed that he (Mohsin) has succumbed to burn injuries, but his body is yet to be identified. He used to work at a generator repair shop in Noida.â 22-year-old Sulemanâs body was brought to his native village in Hapur on Friday evening for burial. A resident of Babugarh area in Hapur, Suleman was a daily wage worker. A Bulandshahr resident, Shahid Khan (25), an auto-rickshaw driver who got married three months ago, was returning home after dropping a passenger when he was killed. His family buried him on Thursday, two days after the death. Shaban Aziz (22), a labourer, was the third casuality from Bulandshahr. He lived with his family in Delhiâs Gokulpuri area. âEfforts are being made by officials to address grievances of the victimsâ families. We are taking the help of local religious leaders to check escalation of tension,â a senior police official said. "
53,"NEW DELHI: A special court, which was designated to hear cases of the northeast Delhi riots that took place in February this year, has dismissed bail applications of seven men accused of rioting. While three men had sought bail in the same FIR, four others were booked in different FIRs connected to the riots. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav refused bail to three menâ Baudeen, Wasim and Sajid â for the investigation was under way. The prosecutor in this case referred to âheavy damage to government and public propertyâ and âloss of lifeâ. All three men were allegedly identified in a CCTV footage that showed them moving around with a stick in their hands. âThere is also clear electronic evidence against the applicant. In this view of the matter, I am not inclined to admit the applicant on bail at this stage,â the court observed. Another accused Kundan was stated to be involved in 12 other cases that were being investigated, the court noted. An eyewitnessâs account apparently revealed that he had flung a small gas cylinder and âset bikes and cycles on fireâ inside a mosque to âenhance the fire and blast the mosqueâ. The court took note of the âgravity of the allegations,â saying it was not a fit case for grant of bail. Similarly, another FIR against Manoj Kumar was based on âclear evidenceâ that showed him âvandalising a vehicleâ. In this case, the prosecutor had argued that communal clashes took place between anti-CAA and pro-CAA protesters during which the accused was seen vandalising a car. The court observed that the investigation was in progress and it was not inclined to allow bail to Kumar at the current stage. The investigation in another FIR against Manish Kumar was found to be ongoing. The court said there was âprima facie evidence of riotingâ against the applicant. Police had accused him of being part of the mob that vandalised a shop and set it on fire. â...I do not find it to be a fit case for grant of bail to the applicant,â the court held. In the case of accused Raj Kumar arising out of another FIR, there was âprima facie evidence of involvement of the applicant in the riotsâ. He had allegedly carried a sword and a knife at the time of riots with the police recovering a sword from his terrace later. The court, as a result, held, âConsidering the seriousness of allegations against the applicant, recovery of sword at his instance and the stage of investigation, I am not inclined to admit the applicant on bail at this stage. The bail application is accordingly dismissed.â "
54,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Friday granted bail to Faizan Khan, the man who supplied SIM card to Delhi riots accused and Jamia scholar Asif Iqbal Tanha, after observing that invocation of UAPA against him was based on nothing but ""bald statements"". ""The material on record and the investigating agency's status report do not disclose the commission of the offences under the UAPA, 1967, except the bald statements of the witnesses,"" a single judge bench of the high court comprising Justice Suresh Kumar Kait noted while granting bail to Khan. The bench also said that there is no proof on record such as CCTV footage, video clip or chat record of the petitioner with any of the group, except the allegation that he provided SIM card on a fake ID in December 2019 and took a small amount of Rs 200 for the same. ""It is not the case of the prosecution that he provided many SIM cards and continued to do the same. It is also not the case of the prosecution that he was part of any chat group or part of any group which conspired to commit offence as alleged in the present case,"" the bench said. The court, while granting bail to the petitioner, directed him to submit a personal bail bond of Rs 25,000 with one surety of the like amount. ""I am of the view that the petitioner deserves bail,"" the bench said. The court noted that for invoking the UAPA against the petitioner, it is the duty of the investigating agency to demonstrate that the petitioner had ""actual knowledge"" that the said SIM card would be used for organising protests. ""It was imperative for the investigating agency to demonstrate that the petitioner had 'active knowledge' about the utilisation of the said SIM card. It is not alleged that the petitioner was party to any such conspiracy to organise protests,"" the bench said. The court also observed that the petitioner voluntarily appeared before the agency for questioning and did not evade or flee between the period of registration of the FIR (March 6) and the date of his arrest (July 29). ""This is material fact shows that the petitioner has fully cooperated with the probe and had made himself available as and when directed by the investigating agency,"" the bench noted. The court also directed that the petitioner shall not directly or indirectly influence any witness or tamper with the evidence. ""The trial court shall not get influenced by the observation made by this court while passing the order in the present petition,"" it said. Khan was arrested by the Delhi Police on July 29 on charges of being part of the conspiracy hatched by Umar Khalid and his associates to organise the riots in north-east Delhi during the visit of US President Donald Trump in February 2020. Khan had allegedly supplied and activated a SIM card registered fraudulently in the name of one Abdul Jabbar, but actually used by the the Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC) headed by Jamia student Safoora Zargar. "
55,"NEW DELHI: A separate FIR has been filed by Special Cell of Delhi Police to probe the âlarger conspiracyâ behind the riots in northeast Delhi. Police have invoked the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), apart from IPC sections on criminal conspiracy and sedition. Jamia Millia Islamia students Meeran Haidar and Safoora Zargar were first arrested by northeast district police and then by Special Cell through this FIR. Seven others, including activists like Gulfisha and Khalid Saifi, have been arrested in this case taking the number of accused to nine. Six of the nine accused, including Haidar and Zargar, are now booked under UAPA. They have also been booked for sedition and promoting enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion and rioting. Former Jawaharlal Nehru University student Umar Khalid, who is already facing trial for sedition in the Afzal Guru commemoration event of 2016, is also under probe in this FIR for his hate speeches given against Citizenship Amendment Act, a senior officer said. Haider and Zargar, who are members of Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC), are in judicial custody. While Haider is a PhD student and president of RJD youth wingâs in Delhi, Zargar is an MPhil student at Jamia and the media coordinator of JCC. The communal riots, which broke out on February 23, led to the deaths of over 50 people. Police in northeast district have filed close to 750 FIRs in connection with the riots and have arrested many on charges of murder and attempted murder. The cases are now being probed by the Crime Branch. The Special Cellâs FIR has been lodged on a tip-off from intelligence agencies and inputs obtained by the special branch. The case has been lodged on the statement of a Special Cell sleuth saying that the communal violence was fallout of a âpremeditated conspiracyâ. A probe is on in Khalidâs two extremely provocative speeches in which he allegedly appealed to people to block the roads during the visit of US President Donald Trump to make treatment of minorities in India an international issue. According to the latest FIR, the accused were assigned responsibilities to congregate people from different areas and make women and children block the roads under Jafrabad metro station to fuel tension in the area. This was something that reportedly triggered the riots. The FIR also focuses on the preparations for the riots that saw massive use of firearms, Molotov cocktails, acid bottles, bricks and stones. All these things were collected inside numerous homes and on terraces over a period of time. "
56,"NEW DELHI: High density population, narrow lanes and bylanes in the northeast Delhi areas had restricted the movement of forces and vehicles during the riots last month, the Union home ministry said in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. MoS (home) G Kishan Reddy, in written reply to a question, said Delhi Police acted swiftly and professionally nevertheless, ensuring the disturbance was contained and not allowed to spread. Reddy said as reported by Delhi Police, until March 12,763 cases, including 51 cases under Arms Act had been registered; 3,304 persons arrested/ detained; 52 persons killed and 545 injured; and 226 houses and 487 shops damaged in the riots. "
57,"NEW DELHI: Investigation in cases of riots often hits a roadblock due to lack of evidence. It becomes even more difficult to ascertain the correct sequence of events, let alone identifying the rioters. However, thanks to the video footage available with them, Delhi Police is sure that the perpetrators of the recent riots will be brought to books. Apart from the CCTV footage from the affected areas, mobile videos shot by the residents have also helped the cops join the missing dots and place a verified sequence on record. Soon after formation of the SIT in the riots, Delhi Police had appealed to people to share whatever video evidence they had recorded during the riots. According to additional commissioner, Mandeep Singh Randhawa, Delhi Police has till date received as many as 2,162 videos from public. Police are carefully examining the authenticity of the videos before using them to identify the rioters, said a source. âThe videos are carefully examined for any tampering by our video experts and then inventoried and categorised based on areas and case FIRs,â he added. Of the 2,162 videos received, police have filtered out only 1,330 usable videos. Many of the videos received were similar too. âAfter categorisation, the videos are manually analysed by showing them to locals and informers. They are then run through a software, which uses facial recognition technology, to identify the suspects.â Police are also selecting the videos sent by people who had recorded them themselves on their mobile phones. ""These videos are being sent for forensic analysis and can be used as an evidence in the court as well. Forwarded videos can aide in investigation, but not be placed on record in court,â a senior cop said. From the sensational murders of head constable Ratan Lal to the killing of IB official Ankit Sharma - the videos have played a crucial role during the probe. The mystery of four bodies recovered from the drains in northeast Delhi was largely solved using the video footage. Police had also managed to solve the case of arson at a house, in which a 85-year-old woman died of asphyxia, using video footage. "

59,"NEW DELHI: A Delhi court has issued non-bailable warrant (NBW) against a man who was out on bail in a case registered under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, after he failed to appear before it in a case of north-east Delhi riots in February last year. Additional sessions judge Amitabh Rawat issued NBW against Faizan Khan in the case after he did not appear before the court despite repeated calls. ""Since accused Faizan Khan is absent despite repeated calls, hence, issue NBW against him with notice to his surety for next date of hearing,"" the court said in its order passed on March 25. Khan's counsel said she will move an application for cancellation of NBW against him. The court also directed the police to supply hard copies of the charge sheets filed in the matter to all the 18 accused and put up the matter for further hearing on April 8. Khan, then salesperson of a telecom service provider who allegedly sold a SIM card on a fake ID to co-accused Asif Iqbal Tanha, was granted bail by the Delhi High Court in October last year. The police had alleged that the SIM card obtained on a fake ID was used to coordinate protests against the CAA. While granting him the relief, the high court had said ""it is not the case of the investigating agency that the petitioner (Khan) was part of any such WhatsApp groups which were made to coordinate/ organise protests against the CAA. Moreover, there is no allegation against the petitioner that he engaged in any form of terror funding or such other ancillary activity"". It had further said that the transaction relating to the SIM card had allegedly taken place in December 2019, whereas the violence erupted in north east Delhi around February 23-25, 2020. The high court had said that Khan shall not directly or indirectly influence any witness or tamper with the evidence and added that the trial court shall not be influenced by the observations in the present matter. Communal violence had broken out in north-east Delhi on February 24 last year after clashes between citizenship law supporters and protesters spiralled out of control leaving at least 53 people dead and around 200 injured. "
60,"NEW DELHI: A man accused of rioting in northeast Delhi in February was granted bail by a Delhi court on the ground that he was identified by a police constable much later after the incident. Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadavâs order called it prima facie a âvery weakâ evidence. âIf the constable was present at the time of the riots at the spot and had identified the applicant as one of the rioters, then the least he should have done was to report him at the police station. But he didnât. His naming the applicant in his statement on March 7 is a very weak evidence,â it said. The constable, in his statement, had named Ahmed and two others accusing them of unlawful assembly and causing damage to a school. Seeking bail for the accused, Ahmed, advocate Abdul Gaffar argued that though the incident took place on February 25, the FIR had been registered on March 5 and his client was arrested on March 16. âThe applicant is not named in the FIR. There is no CCTV footage in which he can be seen. There is no call data record (CDR) of the applicant. He has been arrested merely on the basis of constable Piyushâs statement,â Gaffar argued. Special public prosecutor DK Bhatia claimed that the delay in filing of the FIR was owing to the rampant nature of riots and curfew-like situation in the area. âThe situation attained normalcy only in the first week of March. Thereafter, complainants started reporting to police,â he argued. Bhatia added that Piyush was the areaâs beat constable and knew Ahmed resided there. The court held that after Ahmedâs arrest, the investigating officer should have got his judicial test identification parade conducted. âThe applicant is admittedly not seen in any CCTV footage. His CDR locations are also not there on record,â it added. "
61,"NEW DELHI: The Special Cell has formally arrested a man named Haseen Qureshi for allegedly being involved in the murder of intelligence official Ankit Sharma during the northeast Delhi riots. Police claimed his interrogation had, for the first time, shed light on what transpired at the Pulia in Chand Bagh where Sharma was brutally killed by a mob. Qureshi, who was arrested by the southwestern range of the Special Cell on Thursday, has reportedly told the cops that he was present in the area with his friend Sameer. Around 2pm, he saw violence had broken out in the area and decided to join in. He told cops they mingled in the crowd and started throwing stones at people from the other community who had gathered on the other side of the Pulia. In the meantime, Qureshi picked up a knife kept near the stall of a sweet shop and stood on the road near the residence of suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, a source said. Hussain, along with his brother Shah Alam, has been arrested on the charges of hatching a conspiracy that led to Sharmaâs murder. After walking around for some time, Qureshi saw that a group of 20-30 people had been dragging a person from the other side of the Pulia to this side, said the source. Qureshi claimed he didnât know the manâs identity. As he rushed towards the group, police claimed, he saw the mob brutally thrashing the man with sticks, stones and other objects and stabbed the person three times and also kicked him. He apparently told the cops that as the man stopped responding after a few minutes, they picked up his body and threw it in the drain. The next day â when Sharmaâs body was recovered from the Chand Bagh drain â Qureshi identified the man from the photograph being shown on the television and went underground. He was nabbed by a Special Cell team led by DCP Sanjeev Yadav, who had formed a team comprising of ACP Sanjay Dutt and inspectors Atul Tyagi and Dalip Kumar to work on technical intelligence. By deploying sources on the ground to develop the electronic leads, the team zeroed in on Qureshi, whose location was found to be around the spot where Sharma was killed. The Special Cell is hoping to identify other killers with the help of Qureshi, who has been remanded in police custody. "
62,"LUCKNOW: Aam Aadmi Party MP Sanjay Singh demanded a probe monitored by Supreme Court or high court into Delhi riots and said he would raise the matter in Parliament on Monday and ask for setting up a joint parliamentary committee for an inquiry into the outbreak of violence which left 43 people dead. Speaking to reporters in Lucknow on Sunday, the Rajya Sabha MP said that preparations for large scale violence had been made before Delhi elections. âBJP members had been inciting people with provocative speeches and the violence would have taken place before Delhi election had our party not flagged off the matter. Outsiders were brought from Loni and west UP to carry out violence, which is why AAP had demanded immediate closure of borders,â Singh said. On being told that an AAP councillor is accused of orchestrating violence and has been booked for murder, Singh said law will take its own course and demanded narco test of all members of all political parties and it should be telecast live. âIf one wants to find out the truth behind riots, who instigated them and indulged in violence, conduct narco test of BJP and AAP members and telecast it live on TV. It will reveal who was behind violence,â he said. "
63,"NEW DELHI: Following a Delhi court's directions, Delhi Police's Special Cell registered an FIR into the allegations of forgery and false deposition by a complainant on the alleged instigation of a lawyer in a case related to northeast violence. ""FIR dated August 22 has been registered at Special Cell. Progress of investigation shall be submitted before this court as and when directed,"" additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav was informed. The case stemmed from a complaint filed by Irshad Ali on March 4, about his shop being looted and burnt during the riots. Ali subsequently filed two complaints, accusing the investigating officer of mala fide intentions. Since this became ground for a bail application of an accused, the court had directed police to file a report in the matter. The report of the DCP alleged that Ali had changed his stance after a lawyer instigated him to ""depose falsely"" by way of a ""forged affidavit"". "
64,"BENGALURU: Insurers said, even though the normal window was 15 days for filing a claim, in case of riots they will make exceptions and all claims will be honoured. Both public and private-sector insurers cited, instances of vehicle damage and burnt vehicles in UP riots/CAA protests in October and November. âThere is always a provision for condoning the delay of intimation, for claims covered under policy, in case of genuine circumstances,â said Atul Sahai, CEO, New India. Damage such as fire or looting, resulting from riots or civil disturbance is covered under standard policies for home insurance, business insurance and motor insurance. Insurers said they had mostly faced vehicle damage claims than property damage claims in UP and they expect the same situation in Delhi. This was not because there was less damage to property, but because less number of people had taken home and business protection insurance. With motor insurance being mandatory in India, vehicle damage formed the bulk of claims filed. In UP riots, insurers said some claims had come in nearly a month later, which they still honoured - as it had taken time for normalcy to be restored. ""We will of course take the ground situation into account and extend a certain grace period,"" said Sanjay Datta, chief underwriting claims, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Insurers also said that one's action or inaction during a riot is immaterial to payout of the claim. ""The policyholder can be in a hospital or jail, but the claim will still be honoured,"" said another insurer. "
65,"NEW DELHI: A city court on Saturday granted interim bail to former Congress municipal councillor Ishrat Jahan to get married. She has been booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) in a case related to communal violence in northeast Delhi in February this year. The relief of bail will be applicable from June 10 to June 19. Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana allowed the relief to Jahan on a bond of Rs 1 lakh with two sureties. After the prosecutor submitted that the fact of Jahanâs scheduled marriage had been verified, the court held, âConsidering the factum of scheduled marriage of applicant Ishrat Jahan, she be released on interim bail for 10 days.â The bail plea, filed through advocate Lalit Valecha, also argued that she being a former municipal councillor was falsely implicated in the case and sent to judicial custody. It was also argued that despite obtaining bail in another case, she was arrested in the present case on March 21, 2020. Jahan and other accused persons are facing probe in cases stemming from the northeast Delhi violence that took place earlier this year. Among other offences such as rioting and damage to property, the investigation agency has invoked the stringent UAPA law against the accused persons. "
66,"GHAZIABAD: The family of 22-year-old Asad alia Raja hoped against hope for several days about getting news of his wellbeing, but all that was shattered when his body was found at the Guru Teg Bahadur hospital in New Delhi on Monday. Asad, a painter and resident of Loni, was in the riot-hit national capital for some work last Wednesday, after which he went untraceable. His family members said he went missing on February 26 and since then they had been running from pillar to post trying to find out his whereabouts. They contacted several hospitals and friends before going to the police. On Sunday, they reached the Tronica City police station to file a missing complaint for Asad. A senior cop posted there advised the family to contact Karawal Nagar police. After the family reached Karawal Nagar police station on Monday, cops informed them about an unidentified body kept at the GTB hospital. Based on the details given by police, Asadâs family members suspected it to be his body. Along with the Delhi cops, the family members rushed to the hospital and found Asadâs body. Naseem, father of the deceased said, âAround 11am on February 26, he had left for some work, along with his friend. Since then, we didnât hear from him. When we tried calling him on Wednesday evening, his mobile phone was switched off. We donât even know what happened, how he was killed or where he was killed for that matter,â said Naseem. Delhi police told Asadâs family that the body was found on morning of February 27 (Thursday) near toll plaza at Pushta Road. They also said Asad was a victim of the riots that broke out in New Delhi. âWhen I saw Asadâs body in the hospital, I found he had two bullet wounds â one on the right hand and another on the leg. The rioters attacked him and also damaged his face with a sharp object, probably a knife,â Naseem added. âWe are extremely poor and work as daily wage labourers. Asad was looking for some work and we had high hopes from him. What is our fault? The incident has left our family in shock and trauma,â the father said. SP (Rural) Neeraj Kumar Jadaun said Asadâs family did not file complaint. âWhen they came to file a complaint with Ghaziabad police, cops asked them to go Karawal Nagar police station. Delhi cops informed us about the body at GTB hospital. An FIR has been registered in Delhi,â Jadaun added. "
